# Sovry Launchpad – IP-Backed Token Engine

Sovry is a **Pump.fun–style bonding-curve launchpad** for Story Protocol IP assets.

Creators lock a portion of their **Story Protocol Royalty Tokens (RT)** into the Launchpad, which deploys a branded ERC‑20 **wrapper token** and sells it on a bonding curve. When the raise target is hit, the wrapper graduates to a **PiperX V2** pool. Royalties earned by the underlying IP can be **harvested** and injected back into the curve to **boost price**.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

- **Blockchain**: Story Protocol – Aeneid Testnet (chainId 1315)
- **Core Contracts** (Aeneid):
  - `SovryLaunchpad.sol` – bonding curve engine + graduation to PiperX
  - `SovryToken.sol` – simple ERC‑20 wrapper token (one per IP launch)
- **Frontend**: Next.js + TypeScript (in `frontend/`)
  - `/` – Launch grid (from subgraph)
  - `/create` – Launch flow (Register IP → Get RT → Launch)
  - `/pool/[address]` – Trading terminal (chart + trade + comments + harvest)
- **Wallet**: Dynamic.xyz (primary wallet context + viem integration)
- **Indexing**: The Graph / Goldsky subgraph tracking **Launchpad events only**

## ⚙️ Smart Contracts (Aeneid)

> Always check deployed addresses in env / deployment logs; values below are examples.

- **Launchpad** – `SovryLaunchpad`
  - Holds locked RT inventory
  - Mints wrapper tokens
  - Runs bonding curve for buys/sells
  - Calls PiperX V2 router `addLiquidityETH` on graduation
  - Implements Harvest & Pump
- **Wrapper Token** – `SovryToken`
  - `constructor(string name, string symbol, uint256 supply, address owner)`
  - Mints total `supply` to `owner` (Launchpad)
  - `onlyOwner` `mint` and `burnFrom` hooks for Launchpad control

Key on-chain behaviours:

- **Wrapper Pattern**
  - `launchToken(royaltyToken, amount, name, symbol)`
  - Launchpad locks `amount` of RT from creator
  - Deploys a `SovryToken` wrapper and mints `amount` units to itself
  - Emits `WrapperDeployed(royaltyToken, wrapper, name, symbol)` and `Launched(wrapper, creator)`

- **Fractional Listing**
  - `amount` parameter lets creators choose **what % of their RTs** to tokenize
  - Frontend passes `amountToLock = balance * percentage / 100`

- **Bonding Curve**
  - `buy(token)` – pays native IP, takes 0.5% fee to `feeTo`, rest into curve
  - `sell(token, tokenAmount)` – returns IP minus 0.5% fee
  - Curve math uses constant product formula with a **virtual IP reserve**

- **Harvest & Pump**
  - `harvestAndPump(wrapperToken)` – Launchpad (as RT holder) calls Story’s **royalty vault**
    - Checks WIP balance before/after
    - Treats claimed WIP as **free reserve** and adds to `totalRaised`
    - Emits `RevenueInjected(wrapperToken, amount)`

- **Graduation to PiperX**
  - When `totalRaised` ≥ `TARGET_RAISE` (e.g. `100 ether` of IP):
    - `_graduate(token)` calls PiperX router `addLiquidityETH`
    - Supplies all accumulated IP and remaining wrappers
    - Sends LP tokens to `0x...dEaD` (burn) to lock liquidity
    - Emits `Graduated(token, pool, totalLiquidity)`

- **Redemption**
  - `redeem(wrapperToken, amount)` burns wrapper tokens held by user and returns underlying RT 1:1
  - Emits `Redeemed(wrapper, user, amount)`

## 🌐 Frontend Apps

### `frontend/` – Next.js App Router

- **Navigation**
  - `Home` – `/`
  - `Create` – `/create`
  - `Profile` – `/profile`

- **Home (`/`) – Launch Grid**
  - Fetches `Launch` entities from the subgraph
  - Shows wrapper token address, creator, and launch date
  - Clicking a card routes to `/pool/[address]` for trading

- **Create (`/create`) – Launch Your IP**
  - Register IP on Story Protocol:
    - Title, Description, Image / Media URL, optional symbol
  - Get Royalty Tokens:
    - Mint license, deploy Story Royalty Vault, transfer RTs to user
  - Configure Launch:
    - Wrapper **name & symbol** (e.g. `Chill Guy`, `CHILL`)
    - **Percentage to Launch** slider (1–100%)
  - Launch on Bonding Curve:
    - Calls `launchOnBondingCurveDynamic(royaltyToken, name, symbol, percentage)`
    - Under the hood: approves Launchpad for `amountToLock` and calls `launchToken`

- **Pool Detail (`/pool/[address]`) – Trading Terminal**
  - Left: Bonding curve chart + IP metadata + license terms + comments
  - Right:
    - Bonding curve progress vs target raise
    - Trade widget (bonding-curve buy/sell)
    - **Harvest Royalties** button:
      - Calls `harvestAndPump(wrapperToken)` via `launchpadService`
      - Tooltip: "Claim pending royalties from Story Protocol to this pool's Launchpad vault and inject them into the bonding curve reserve. This can instantly boost the token price for all holders."

## 📊 Subgraph (Launchpad-Only)

Directory: `subgraph/`

- **Data Source**: `SovryLaunchpad` only (no legacy factory/pool indexing)
- **Tracked Events**:
  - `Launched(token, creator)`
  - `WrapperDeployed(royaltyToken, wrapper, name, symbol)`
  - `Bought(token, buyer, amountIP, amountTokens)`
  - `Sold(token, seller, amountTokens, amountIP)`
  - `RevenueInjected(token, amount)`
  - `Graduated(token, pool, totalLiquidity)`
  - `Redeemed(wrapper, user, amount)`

Core entities in `schema.graphql`:

- `Launch` – one per wrapper token
- `Trade` – all buys/sells on the curve
- `RevenueInjection` – Harvest & Pump events
- `Graduation` – final state when a launch moves to PiperX

Use this subgraph to power the **Home grid**, analytics charts, and profile views.

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

Below is the development roadmap for Sovry, focused on pivoting from a standard AMM to a Bonding Curve Launchpad model.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Smart Contracts (The Pivot) 🏗️
**Focus:** Replacing the old DEX infrastructure with the new Bonding Curve Launchpad engine.

- [x] **Architecture Design**
  - Pivot from AMM Model (Factory/Router) to Bonding Curve Model (Launchpad).
  - Set Graduation Target to **PiperX V2** (Major Story Protocol DEX).

- [ ] **Smart Contract Development**
  - `SovryToken.sol`: Implement a standard, mintable/burnable ERC-20 Wrapper Contract.
  - `SovryLaunchpad.sol`:
    - **Bonding Curve Logic:** Implement linear price curve with buy/sell functions.
    - **Wrapper Mechanism:** `launchToken` function to accept Royalty Tokens (RT), lock them in the vault, and mint Wrapper Tokens.
    - **Fractional Listing:** Logic to accept a specific amount of RT to lock (allowing 10-100% listing).
    - **Harvest & Pump:** Implement `harvestAndPump()` to claim royalties from Story Protocol and inject them into the curve's liquidity reserve (raising floor price).
    - **Graduation:** Implement `_graduate()` to migrate liquidity to PiperX V2 Router and burn LP tokens.
    - **Fee System:** Implement 0.5% trading fee routed to the Treasury.

- [x] **Deployment Scripts**
  - Create `scripts/deploy-launchpad.ts`.
  - Verify contracts on **StoryScan (Aeneid)**.

---

### Phase 2: Frontend Refactor (UI/UX Overhaul) 🎨
**Focus:** Transforming the UI from a "Swap Interface" to a "Social Trading Terminal".

- [x] **Legacy Code Cleanup**
  - Remove obsolete pages: Liquidity, Pools, Swap (Old).
  - Remove obsolete services calling the internal Factory/Router.

- [ ] **New "Home" Page (The Gallery)**
  - Grid layout displaying newly launched tokens.
  - Cards showing: IP Image, Ticker, Market Cap, & Bonding Curve Progress.
  - Search/Filter by Name or Category.

  - **Native Story Integration:** Fetch and preview IP Media directly from Story Protocol metadata (No manual upload).
  - **Fractional Slider:** UI to select "Percentage of IP to List" (1% - 100%).
  - **Transaction Flow:** Register IP -> Mint License -> Approve -> Launch.

- [ ] **New "Token Detail" Page (The Terminal)**
  - **Left Column:** Real-time TradingView Chart (Lightweight Charts) + IP Metadata/License Terms.
  - **Right Column:** Buy/Sell Interface (Bonding Curve) + Slippage Settings.
  - **Bottom Section:** Tabs for "Holder Distribution", "Transaction History", and "Comments".

---

### Phase 3: Data & Social Layer (Backend) 🗄️
**Focus:** Ensuring data speed and community engagement.

- [x] **Indexer (Goldsky Subgraph)**

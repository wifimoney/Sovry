## Introducing the World's IP Blockchain

Story is a purpose-built layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for intellectual property.

You can register your IP on-chain and add usage terms to it in seconds, massively lowering the barrier to the currently complex & antiquated legal system for IP. For example, enforcing "you owe me 50% of your commercial revenue if you use my IP" without needing time, money, or lawyers.

<Note>
  IP could be an image, a song, an RWA, AI training data, or anything
  in-between.
</Note>

By making IP programmable on the blockchain, it becomes this transparent & decentralized global IP repository where AI agents (or any other software) and humans alike can transact on & monetize IP with a simple API call.

<Accordion title="Why did we build Story?" icon="face-thinking">
  When IP owners share their work online, it’s easy for others to use or change it without crediting them, and they often don't get paid fairly if their work becomes popular or valuable. This can be discouraging for people who want to share their ideas and creations but don’t want to lose control over them.

  Additionally, the sheer speed and superabundance of AI-generated media is outpacing the current IP system that was designed for physical replication. In many cases, [AI is trained on and is producing copyrighted data](https://twitter.com/BriannaWu/status/1823833723764084846).

  Story fixes this by providing a way for creators to share their work with built-in protection. When someone (including an AI model) uses a song, image, or any creative work that’s registered on Story, the system automatically tracks who the original owner is and makes sure they get credited. Plus, if that work generates revenue—say someone remixes a song and it earns money—the original owner automatically receives their fair share based on license terms that were set on-chain.

### Story Network: "The World's IP Blockchain"

Story Network is a purpose-built layer 1 blockchain achieving the best of EVM and Cosmos SDK. It is 100% EVM-compatible alongside deep execution layer optimizations to support graph data structures, purpose-built for handling complex data structures like IP quickly and cost-efficiently. It does this by:

* using precompiled primitives to traverse complex data structures like IP graphs within seconds at marginal costs
* a consensus layer based on the mature CometBFT stack to ensure fast finality and cheap transactions

### "Proof-of-Creativity" Protocol

Our "Proof-of-Creativity" Protocol, made up of smart contracts written in Solidity, are natively deployed on Story Network and allow anyone to onramp IP to Story. Most of our documentation focuses on the protocol.

Creators register their IP as [🧩 IP Assets](/concepts/ip-asset) on Story. You use [🧱 Modules](/concepts/modules) to interact with IP Assets. For example, enforcing proper usage of your IP via the [Licensing Module](/concepts/licensing-module), paying & claiming revenue via the [Royalty Module](/concepts/royalty-module), and disputing infringing IP via the [Dispute Module](/concepts/dispute-module).

Each IP Asset has an associated ERC721 NFT, which represents *ownership* over the IP. This means IP ownership can be bought & sold. Additionally, the licenses minted from an IP are also ERC721 NFTs, meaning you can buy & sell the rights to use an IP under certain terms. Together, this unlocks a new realm of **IPFi**.

### Programmable IP License

Although on-chain, an IP's usage terms and minted licenses are enforced by an off-chain legal contract called the [Programmable IP License (PIL💊)](/concepts/programmable-ip-license).

The PIL allows anyone to offramp tokenized IP on Story into the "real world" legal system and outlines real legal terms for how creators can remix, monetize, and create derivatives of their IP. *The protocol, or more specifically the IP Assets and modules described above, are what automate and enforce those terms on-chain*, creating a mapping between the legal world (PIL) and the blockchain.

<Note>
  Like USDC enables redemption for fiat, the PIL enables redemption for IP.

## Examples

<Accordion title="Example #1" icon="circle-info">
  Imagine you're an artist who creates digital paintings, or a musician who makes original songs. You want to share your work online, but you want to ensure that if others use or change your work, they give you credit and—if they make money from it—you get a share. That’s where Story comes in. It's a platform that uses technology to give IP owners like you control over how your work is used, tracked, and shared, so it’s both protected and fairly rewarded.

  Think of it like this: Suppose you upload a song to Story. Now, anyone can see that you’re the original creator, and if someone wants to remix it, they can do so through Story. The system then automatically tracks the remix as a "derivative" of your song and notes you as the original artist. This way, if the remix becomes popular and earns money, Story can help you earn a portion of those earnings, just like the remixer.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example #2" icon="circle-info">
  Let’s say a scientist uploads an image dataset to be used by artificial intelligence (AI) models for research. Through Story, that dataset is registered, so if any company uses it to train their AI, the original scientist is credited. If that dataset then contributes to a profitable AI application, Story ensures a fair share goes to the original contributor.

  With Story, you can share your work freely, knowing that wherever it goes, it’s tracked and fairly credited back to you. The idea is to create a fair environment for sharing, building upon, and growing creative work.
</Accordion>
# 💊 Programmable IP License (PIL)

> Story Programmable IP License - A legal framework for IP licensing on-chain

The PIL is a legal off-chain document based on US copyright law created by the Story team.

The parameters outlined in the PIL (ex. "Commercial Use", "Derivatives Allowed", etc) have been mapped on-chain, which means they can be enforced on-chain via our protocol, bridging code and law and unlocking the benefit of transparent, autonomous, and permission-less smart contracts for the world of intellectual property.

</CardGroup>

The PIL is the first and currently only example of a [License Template](/concepts/licensing-module/license-template). A License Template is simply a traditional legal document that has been brought on-chain and contains a set of pre-defined terms that people must set, like:

* `commercialUse` - can someone use my work commercially?
* `mintingFee` - the cost of minting a license to use my work in your own works.
* `derivativesAttribution` - does someone have to credit me in their derivative works?

In code, these terms form a struct that represent their legal off-chain counterparts. To see all of the terms defined by the PIL and their associated explanations in code, see [PIL Terms](/concepts/programmable-ip-license/pil-terms).

To see example configurations ("flavors") of the PIL, see [PIL Flavors (examples)](/concepts/programmable-ip-license/pil-flavors).

## The Background Story

<Note>
  If you just want to get started developing with the PIL, you can skip this section.
</Note>

We designed Story's [📜 Licensing Module](/concepts/licensing-module/overview) to power the expansion of emerging forms of creativity, such as authorized remixes and co-creation. Our protocol can support any media format or project, ranging from user-generated social videos & images to Hollywood-grade collaborative storytelling.

Intellectual property owners can permit other parties to use, or build on, their work by granting rights in a license, which can be for profit or for the common good. In the media world, these licenses are generally highly tailored contracts, which vary by media formats and the unique needs of licensors - often requiring unique expertise (via lawyers) and significant resources to create.

We searched for a form of a "universal license" that could support these emerging activities at scale. Hat tip to [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/mission/), [Arweave](https://mirror.xyz/0x64eA438bd2784F2C52a9095Ec0F6158f847182d9/AjNBmiD4A4Sw-ouV9YtCO6RCq0uXXcGwVJMB5cdfbhE), A16Z / [Can't Be Evil,](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/introducing-nft-licenses/) The [Token-Bound NFT License](https://james.grimmelmann.net/files/articles/token-bound-nft-license.pdf) and music rights organizations, among others. But we simply couldn't find one framework or agreement robust enough - so with our expert legal counsel (with special thanks to Ghaith Mahmood and Heather Liu) we created one ourselves! **Introducing the Programmable IP License (PIL:pill:)**, the first example of a [License Template](/concepts/licensing-module/license-template) on the protocol.

<Tip>Every license created on Story is a real, enforceable legal contract.</Tip>

## The Programmable IP License (PIL): The Foundation of Legal Enforcement

At its core, every [IP Asset](/concepts/ip-asset) registered on Story is wrapped by a **legally binding document called the [Programmable IP License (PIL)](/concepts/programmable-ip-license)**. Based on US copyright law, the PIL acts as a universal license agreement template that allows IP owners to attach customizable terms to their assets.

**Licensing on Story means making a genuine legal commitment.** The parameters defined in the PIL—commercial use, derivative allowances, attribution requirements, and royalty structures—represent legally enforceable terms between the IP owner (licensor) and anyone who licenses the IP (licensee).

### How does the PIL enable enforcement?

* **Clear Legal Terms:** The PIL provides a standardized way for IP owners to define usage rules.
* **On-Chain Record as Evidence:** PIL terms attached to an IP Asset are recorded immutably on Story's purpose-built blockchain, serving as *irrefutable evidence* of the agreed-upon terms.
* **Off-Chain Legal Recourse:** If IP is misused in violation of PIL terms, the IP owner can leverage on-chain evidence in **off-chain legal proceedings** such as arbitration or court actions.
* **License Tokens as Proof of Rights:** Licensees receive a [**License Token**](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token) (NFT) representing specific usage rights granted under the PIL terms, providing further evidence of authorization status.

## The Story Attestation Service (SAS): Proactive Infringement Monitoring

Beyond the legal framework, we are building the [**Story Attestation Service (SAS)**](/concepts/story-attestation-service) to help IP owners monitor for potential copyright infringement using a multi-layered decentralized approach.

<Note>
  SAS is a signal layer, not a judgment layer—it flags potential issues for the
  IP owner to act upon, rather than taking automated enforcement actions.
</Note>

### How the SAS Helps with Infringement Detection:

* **Network of Specialized Providers:** SAS coordinates with service providers like Yakoa and Pex that use AI and machine learning to detect copyright violations across different media types on the internet and other blockchains.
* **Transparent Signals:** SAS provides publicly accessible signals regarding the legitimacy of an IP Asset based on provider findings.
* **Focus on Commercial IP:** Currently, SAS primarily runs infringement checks on commercial IP Assets—those with at least one License Terms where `commercialUse = true`.
* **Metadata-Driven Checks:** SAS relies on IP-specific metadata provided during registration to perform checks against existing online content.

### Important Considerations:

* **Detection, Not Prevention:** SAS primarily flags potential infringements after IP registration rather than preventing them.
* **Internet-Based Checks:** Currently, SAS primarily detects infringement based on content already existing online, not offline uses.
* **No Guarantee of Perfection:** No system can guarantee 100% detection of all copyright infringement.

## The Role of the Dispute Module

We have also built a [**Dispute Module**](/concepts/dispute-module) that allows anyone to raise on-chain disputes against IP Assets for reasons such as improper registration or potential plagiarism. This can lead to on-chain flagging of disputed IP, potentially affecting its ability to generate licenses or earn revenue.

## The Hybrid Enforcement Model

<Note>
  Story doesn't replace courts or lawyers—it gives IP holders tools that work
  with traditional enforcement systems while benefiting from on-chain
  automation, transparency, and interoperability.
</Note>

### What Story Can Do:

* Provide a legally sound framework for IP licensing through the PIL
* Create an immutable on-chain record of IP ownership and license terms
* Offer monitoring tools through the SAS to detect potential online infringement
* Facilitate on-chain dispute resolution through the Dispute Module
* Provide evidence usable for off-chain legal enforcement

### What Story Cannot Do:

* Act as a global police force for IP infringement
* Guarantee prevention of all unauthorized IP uses
* Directly enforce legal judgments in the physical world
* Monitor every digital and physical interaction with registered IP

## Non-Commercial Social Remixing

<Note>
  This flavor is already registered as `licenseTermsId = 1` on our protocol. This is because it doesn't take any inputs, so we registered it ahead of time.
</Note>

Let the world build on and play with your creation. This license allows for endless free remixing while tracking all uses of your work while giving you full credit. Similar to: TikTok plus attribution.

## Commercial Remix

Let the world build on and play with your creation... and earn money together from it! This license allows for endless free remixing while tracking all uses of your work while giving you full credit, with each derivative paying a percentage of revenue to its "parent" IP.

### Example

Check out Story's official mascot **Ippy**, which we have registered with commercial remix terms on both [Mainnet](https://explorer.story.foundation/ipa/0xB1D831271A68Db5c18c8F0B69327446f7C8D0A42) and [Aeneid Testnet](https://aeneid.explorer.story.foundation/ipa/0x641E638e8FCA4d4844F509630B34c9D524d40BE5).

### Explanation

Someone registers their Azuki on Story. By default, that IP Asset has Non-Commercial Social Remixing Terms, which specify that anyone can create derivatives of that work but cannot commercialize them. So, someone else creates & registers a remix of that work (IPA2) which inherits those same terms. Someone else then does the same to IPA2, creating & registering IPA3.

The owner of IPA1 then decides that others can commercialize the work, but they cannot create derivatives to do so, they must pay a 10 \$WIP minting fee, and they must share 10% of all revenue earned. So, someone wants to commercialize IPA1 by putting it on a t-shirt. They pay the 10 \$WIP minting fee to get a License Token, which represents the license to commercialize IPA1. They then put the image on a t-shirt and sell it. 10% of revenue earned by that t-shirt must be sent on-chain to IPA1.

So, someone wants to commercialize IPA1 by putting it on a t-shirt. They pay the 10 \$WIP minting fee to get a License Token and burn it to create their own derivative, which changes the background color to red. They then put the remixed image on a t-shirt and sell it. 10% of revenue earned by that t-shirt must be sent on-chain to IPA1.

A third person wants to commercialize the remix by putting it in a TV advertisement, but they want to change the hair color to white. So, they pay a 10 \$WIP minting fee (of which, 1 \$WIP gets sent back to IPA1) to create their own derivative. They then put the remixed image in a TV ad. 10% of TV advertising revenue earned must be sent on-chain to IPA4, of which 10% will be distributed back to IPA1.

# On-chain terms

Most PIL terms are on-chain. They are implemented in the `IPILicenseTemplate.sol` contract as a `PILTerms` struct [here](https://github.com/storyprotocol/protocol-core-v1/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/modules/licensing/IPILicenseTemplate.sol).

```solidity IPILicenseTemplate.sol theme={null}
/// @notice This struct defines the terms for a Programmable IP License (PIL).
/// These terms can be attached to IP Assets.
struct PILTerms {
  bool transferable;
  address royaltyPolicy;
  uint256 defaultMintingFee;
  uint256 expiration;
  bool commercialUse;
  bool commercialAttribution;
  address commercializerChecker;
  bytes commercializerCheckerData;
  uint32 commercialRevShare;
  uint256 commercialRevCeiling;
  bool derivativesAllowed;
  bool derivativesAttribution;
  bool derivativesApproval;
  bool derivativesReciprocal;
  uint256 derivativeRevCeiling;

# Off-chain terms to be included in `uri` field

Some PIL terms must be stored off-chain and passed in the `uri` field above. This is because these terms are often more lengthy and/or descriptive, so it would not make sense to store them on-chain.

> Learn how to setup Dynamic Wallet in your Story DApp.

<Note>
  **Optional: Official Dynamic Docs**

  Check out the official Wagmi + Dynamic installation docs [here](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/using-wagmi).
</Note>

## Install the Dependencies

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm theme={null}
  npm install --save @story-protocol/core-sdk viem wagmi @dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core @dynamic-labs/wagmi-connector @dynamic-labs/ethereum @tanstack/react-query
  ```

  pnpm install @story-protocol/core-sdk viem
  ```

  ```bash yarn theme={null}
  yarn add @story-protocol/core-sdk viem
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Setup

Before diving into the example, make sure you have two things setup:

1. Make sure to have `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_PROVIDER_URL` set up in your `.env` file.
   * You can use the public default one (`https://aeneid.storyrpc.io`) or any other RPC [here](/network/network-info/aeneid#rpcs).
2. Make sure to have `NEXT_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_ENV_ID` set up in your `.env` file. Do this by logging into [Dynamic](https://app.dynamic.xyz/) and creating a project.

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx Web3Providers.tsx theme={null}

  import { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
  import { aeneid } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";

  // setup wagmi
  const config = createConfig({
    chains: [aeneid],

# Setup Client

> Learn how to setup the TypeScript SDK.

### Prerequisites

We require node version 18 or later version and npm version 8 to be installed in your environment. To install node and npm, we recommend you go to the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org) and download the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version.

### Install the Dependencies

Install the [Story SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@story-protocol/core-sdk) node package, as well as [viem](https://www.npmjs.com/package/viem).

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm theme={null}
  npm install --save @story-protocol/core-sdk viem
  ```

  ```bash pnpm theme={null}
  pnpm install @story-protocol/core-sdk viem
  ```

  ```bash yarn theme={null}
  yarn add @story-protocol/core-sdk viem
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Initiate SDK Client

Next we can initiate the SDK Client. There are two ways to do this:

1. Using a private key (preferable for some backend admin)
2. JSON-RPC account like Metamask where users sign their own transactions

### Set Up Private Key Account

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Working Example" href="https://github.com/storyprotocol/typescript-tutorial/blob/main/utils/config.ts" icon="thumbs-up">
    Check out the TypeScript Tutorial for a working example of how to set up the
    Story SDK Client.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Before continuing with the code below:

1. Make sure to have `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` set up in your `.env` file.
   * Don’t forget to fund the wallet with some testnet tokens from a [Faucet](/network/network-info/aeneid#faucet)
2. Make sure to have `RPC_PROVIDER_URL` set up in your `.env` file.
   * You can use the public default one (`https://aeneid.storyrpc.io`) or check out the other RPCs [here](/network/network-info/aeneid#rpcs).

```typescript utils.ts theme={null}
import { http } from "viem";
import { Account, privateKeyToAccount, Address } from "viem/accounts";
import { StoryClient, StoryConfig } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";

const privateKey: Address = `0x${process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY}`;
const account: Account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);

const config: StoryConfig = {
  account: account, // the account object from above
  transport: http(process.env.RPC_PROVIDER_URL),
  chainId: "aeneid",
};
export const client = StoryClient.newClient(config);
```

### Setup for React (ex. Metamask)

The [React Setup Guide](/developers/react-guide/setup/overview) shows how we can also use the TypeScript SDK to delay signing & sending transactions to a JSON-RPC account like Metamask.

Let's say you have some off-chain IP (ex. a book, a character, a drawing, etc). In order to register that IP on Story, you first need to mint an NFT. This NFT is the **ownership** over the IP. Then you **register** that NFT on Story, turning it into an [IP Asset](/concepts/ip-asset). The below tutorial will walk you through how to do this.

### Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [TypeScript SDK Setup](/developers/typescript-sdk/setup)
2. \[OPTIONAL] Go to [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) and create a new API key. Add the JWT to your `.env` file:

```text .env theme={null}
PINATA_JWT=<YOUR_PINATA_JWT>
```

3. \[OPTIONAL] Install the `pinata-web3` dependency:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
npm install pinata-web3
```

## 1. Set up your IP Metadata

We can set metadata on our NFT & IP, *but you don't have to*. To do this, view the [IPA Metadata Standard](/concepts/ip-asset/ipa-metadata-standard) and construct your metadata for both your NFT & IP.

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
// you should already have a client set up (prerequisite)
import { client } from "./utils";

async function main() {
  const ipMetadata = {
    title: "Ippy",
    description: "Official mascot of Story.",
    image:
      "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSamy4zqP91X42k6wS7kLJQVzuYJuW2EN94couPaq82A8",
    imageHash:
      "0x21937ba9d821cb0306c7f1a1a2cc5a257509f228ea6abccc9af1a67dd754af6e",
    mediaUrl:
      "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSamy4zqP91X42k6wS7kLJQVzuYJuW2EN94couPaq82A8",
    mediaHash:
      "0x21937ba9d821cb0306c7f1a1a2cc5a257509f228ea6abccc9af1a67dd754af6e",
    mediaType: "image/png",
    creators: [
      {
        name: "Story Foundation",
        address: "0x67ee74EE04A0E6d14Ca6C27428B27F3EFd5CD084",
        description: "The World's IP Blockchain",
        contributionPercent: 100,
        socialMedia: [
          {
            platform: "Twitter",
            url: "https://twitter.com/storyprotocol",
          },
          {
            platform: "Website",
            url: "https://story.foundation",
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  };
}

main();
```

## 2. Set up your NFT Metadata

The NFT Metadata follows the [ERC-721 Metadata Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { IpMetadata } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
import { client } from "./utils";

async function main() {
  // previous code here ...

  const nftMetadata = {
    name: "Ownership NFT",
    description: "This is an NFT representing owernship of our IP Asset.",
    image: "https://picsum.photos/200",
  };
}

main();
```

## 3. Upload your IP and NFT Metadata to IPFS

In a separate `uploadToIpfs` file, create a function to upload your IP & NFT Metadata objects to IPFS:

```typescript uploadToIpfs.ts theme={null}
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata-web3";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT,
});

export async function uploadJSONToIPFS(jsonMetadata: any): Promise<string> {
  const { IpfsHash } = await pinata.upload.json(jsonMetadata);
  return IpfsHash;
}
```

You can then use that function to upload your metadata, as shown below:

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { IpMetadata } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
import { client } from "./utils";
import { uploadJSONToIPFS } from "./uploadToIpfs";
import { createHash } from "crypto";

async function main() {
  // previous code here ...

  const ipIpfsHash = await uploadJSONToIPFS(ipMetadata);
  const ipHash = createHash("sha256")
    .update(JSON.stringify(ipMetadata))
    .digest("hex");
  const nftIpfsHash = await uploadJSONToIPFS(nftMetadata);
  const nftHash = createHash("sha256")
    .update(JSON.stringify(nftMetadata))
    .digest("hex");
}

main();
```

## 4. Register an NFT as an IP Asset

Remember that in order to register a new IP, we first have to mint an NFT, which will represent the underlying ownership of the IP. This NFT then gets "registered" and becomes an [IP Asset](/concepts/ip-asset).

Luckily, we can use the `registerIpAsset` function to mint an NFT and register it as an IP Asset in the same transaction.

This function needs an SPG NFT Contract to mint from.

### 4a. What SPG NFT contract address should I use?

For simplicity, you can use a public collection we have created for you on Aeneid testnet: `0xc32A8a0FF3beDDDa58393d022aF433e78739FAbc`. On Mainnet, or even when testing a real scenario on Aeneid, you should **create your own** contract as described in the "Using a custom ERC-721 contract" section below.

<Accordion title="Using a custom ERC-721 contract" icon="info">
  Using a public collection we provide for you is fine, but when you do this for real, you should make your own NFT Collection for your IPs. You can do this in 2 ways:

  1. Deploy a contract that implements the [ISPGNFT](https://github.com/storyprotocol/protocol-periphery-v1/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/ISPGNFT.sol) interface, or use the SDK's [createNFTCollection](/sdk-reference/nftclient#createnftcollection) function (shown below) to do it for you. This will give you your own SPG NFT Collection that only you can mint from.

  ```typescript createSpgNftCollection.ts theme={null}
  import { zeroAddress } from "viem";
  import { client } from "./utils";

  async function createSpgNftCollection() {
    const newCollection = await client.nftClient.createNFTCollection({
      name: "Test NFTs",
      symbol: "TEST",
      isPublicMinting: false,
      mintOpen: true,
      mintFeeRecipient: zeroAddress,
      contractURI: "",
    });

    console.log("New collection created:", {
      "SPG NFT Contract Address": newCollection.spgNftContract,
      "Transaction Hash": newCollection.txHash,
    });
  }

  createSpgNftCollection();
  ```

  2. Create a custom ERC-721 NFT collection on your own. See a working code example [here](https://github.com/storyprotocol/typescript-tutorial/blob/main/scripts/registration/registerCustom.ts). This is helpful if you **already have a custom NFT contract that has your own custom logic, or if your IPs themselves are NFTs.**
</Accordion>

Here is the code to register an IP:

<Info>
  Associated Docs:
  [ipAsset.registerIpAsset](/sdk-reference/ipasset#registeripasset)
</Info>

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { IpMetadata } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
import { client } from "./utils";
import { uploadJSONToIPFS } from "./uploadToIpfs";
import { createHash } from "crypto";
import { Address } from "viem";

async function main() {
  // previous code here ...

  const response = await client.ipAsset.registerIpAsset({
    nft: {
      type: "mint",
      spgNftContract: "0xc32A8a0FF3beDDDa58393d022aF433e78739FAbc",
    },
    ipMetadata: {
      ipMetadataURI: `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${ipIpfsHash}`,
      ipMetadataHash: `0x${ipHash}`,
      nftMetadataURI: `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${nftIpfsHash}`,
      nftMetadataHash: `0x${nftHash}`,
    },
  });

  console.log(
    `Root IPA created at transaction hash ${response.txHash}, IPA ID: ${response.ipId}`
  );
  console.log(
    `View on the explorer: https://aeneid.explorer.story.foundation/ipa/${response.ipId}`
  );
}

main();
```

## 5. Add License Terms to IP

During the registration process, you can attach [License Terms](/concepts/licensing-module/license-terms) to the IP. This will allow others to mint a license and use your IP, restricted by the terms.

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import {
  IpMetadata,
  PILFlavor,
  WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
} from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
import { client } from "./utils";
import { uploadJSONToIPFS } from "./uploadToIpfs";
import { createHash } from "crypto";
import { Address, parseEther } from "viem";

async function main() {
  // previous code here ...

  const response = await client.ipAsset.registerIpAsset({
    nft: {
      type: "mint",
      spgNftContract: "0xc32A8a0FF3beDDDa58393d022aF433e78739FAbc",
    },
    // [!code ++:9]
    licenseTermsData: [
      {
        terms: PILFlavor.commercialRemix({
          commercialRevShare: 5,
          defaultMintingFee: parseEther("1"), // 1 $IP
          currency: WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
        }),
      },
    ],
    ipMetadata: {
      ipMetadataURI: `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${ipIpfsHash}`,
      ipMetadataHash: `0x${ipHash}`,
      nftMetadataURI: `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${nftIpfsHash}`,
      nftMetadataHash: `0x${nftHash}`,
    },
  });

  console.log(
    `Root IPA created at transaction hash ${response.txHash}, IPA ID: ${response.ipId}`
  );
  console.log(
    `View on the explorer: https://aeneid.explorer.story.foundation/ipa/${response.ipId}`
  );
}

main();
```

# Register a Derivative

</CardGroup>

This section demonstrates how to register an IP Asset as a derivative of another.

### Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [TypeScript SDK Setup](/developers/typescript-sdk/setup)

## 1. Before We Start

Registering a derivative IP Asset requires you have a License Token from the parent IP Assets you plan to be a derivative of. If you don't, the SDK will handle it for you.

### 1a. Why would I ever use a License Token if it's not needed?

There are a few times when **you would need** a License Token to register a derivative:

* The License Token contains private license terms, so you would only be able to register as a derivative if you had the License Token that was manually minted by the owner. More on that [here](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token#private-licenses).
* The License Token (which is an NFT) costs a `mintingFee` to mint, and you were able to buy it on a marketplace for a cheaper price. Then it makes more sense to simply register with the License Token then have to pay the more expensive `defaultMintingFee`.

## 2. Register Derivative

In this example we're going to assume you have no license tokens, the child IP is not yet registered, and you don't have your own NFT contract or an already minted NFT.

<Info>
  Associated Docs:
  [ipAsset.registerDerivativeIpAsset](/sdk-reference/ipasset#registerderivativeipasset)
</Info>

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { IpMetadata, DerivativeData } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
import { client } from "./utils";
import { uploadJSONToIPFS } from "./uploadToIpfs";
import { createHash } from "crypto";
import { Address } from "viem";

async function main() {
  // previous code here ...

  const derivData = {
    // TODO: insert the parent's ipId
    parentIpIds: [PARENT_IP_ID],
    // TODO: insert the licenseTermsId attached to parent IpId
    licenseTermsIds: [LICENSE_TERMS_ID],
  };

  const response = await client.ipAsset.registerDerivativeIpAsset({
    nft: {
      type: "mint",
      spgNftContract: "0xc32A8a0FF3beDDDa58393d022aF433e78739FAbc",
    },
    derivData,
    ipMetadata: {
      ipMetadataURI: `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${ipIpfsHash}`,
      ipMetadataHash: `0x${ipHash}`,
      nftMetadataURI: `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${nftIpfsHash}`,
      nftMetadataHash: `0x${nftHash}`,
    },
  });

  console.log(
    `Completed at transaction hash ${response.txHash}, IPA ID: ${response.ipId}, Token ID: ${response.tokenId}`
  );
}
```

## 4. Paying and Claiming Revenue

Now that we have established parent-child IP relationships, we can begin to explore payments and automated revenue share based on the license terms. We'll cover that in the upcoming pages.
# Attach Terms to an IPA

> Learn how to Attach License Terms to an IP Asset in TypeScript.

This section demonstrates how to attach [License Terms](/concepts/licensing-module/license-terms) to an [IP Asset](/concepts/ip-asset). By attaching terms, users can publicly mint [License Tokens](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token) (the on-chain "license") with those terms from the IP.

### Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [TypeScript SDK Setup](/developers/typescript-sdk/setup)

## 1. Before We Start

We should mention that you do not need an existing IP Asset to attach terms to it. As we saw in the previous section, you can register an IP Asset and attach terms to it in the same transaction.

## 2. Register License Terms

In order to attach terms to an IP Asset, let's first create them!

[License Terms](/concepts/licensing-module/license-terms) are a configurable set of values that define restrictions on licenses minted from your IP that have those terms. For example, "If you mint this license, you must share 50% of your revenue with me." You can view the full set of terms in [PIL Terms](/concepts/programmable-ip-license/pil-terms).

<Note>
  If License Terms already exist on our protocol for the identical set of parameters you intend to create, it is unnecessary to create it again and the function will simply return the existing `licenseTermsId` and an undefined `txHash`. License Terms are protocol-wide, so you can use existing License Terms by its `licenseTermsId`.
</Note>

Below is a code example showing how to create new terms:

<Info>
  Associated Docs:
  [license.registerPILTerms](/sdk-reference/license#registerpilterms)
</Info>

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { LicenseTerms } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
import { zeroAddress } from "viem";
// you should already have a client set up (prerequisite)
import { client } from "./utils";

async function main() {
  const licenseTerms: LicenseTerms = {
    defaultMintingFee: 0n,
    // must be a whitelisted revenue token from https://docs.story.foundation/developers/deployed-smart-contracts
    // in this case, we use $WIP
    currency: "0x1514000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    // RoyaltyPolicyLAP address from https://docs.story.foundation/developers/deployed-smart-contracts
    royaltyPolicy: "0xBe54FB168b3c982b7AaE60dB6CF75Bd8447b390E",
    transferable: false,
    expiration: 0n,
    commercialUse: false,
    commercialAttribution: false,
    commercializerChecker: zeroAddress,
    commercializerCheckerData: "0x",
    commercialRevShare: 0,
    commercialRevCeiling: 0n,
    derivativesAllowed: false,
    derivativesAttribution: false,
    derivativesApproval: false,
    derivativesReciprocal: false,
    derivativeRevCeiling: 0n,
    uri: "",
  };

  const response = await client.license.registerPILTerms({
    ...licenseTerms,
  });

  console.log(
    `PIL Terms registered at transaction hash ${response.txHash}, License Terms ID: ${response.licenseTermsId}`
  );
}

main();
```

### 2a. PIL Flavors

As you see above, you have to choose between a lot of terms.

We have convenience functions to help you register new terms. We have created [PIL Flavors](/concepts/programmable-ip-license/pil-flavors), which are pre-configured popular combinations of License Terms to help you decide what terms to use. You can view those PIL Flavors and then register terms using the following convenience functions:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card title="Non-Commercial Social Remixing" href="/concepts/programmable-ip-license/pil-flavors#non-commercial-social-remixing" icon="file">
    Free remixing with attribution. No commercialization.
  </Card>

  {" "}

  <Card title="Commercial Use" href="/concepts/programmable-ip-license/pil-flavors#commercial-use" icon="file">
    Pay to use the license with attribution, but don't have to share revenue.
  </Card>

  {" "}

  <Card title="Commercial Remix" href="/concepts/programmable-ip-license/pil-flavors#commercial-remix" icon="file">
    Pay to use the license with attribution and pay % of revenue earned.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Creative Commons Attribution" href="/concepts/programmable-ip-license/pil-flavors#creative-commons-attribution" icon="file">
    Free remixing and commercial use with attribution.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

You can easily register a flavor of terms like so:

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { PILFlavor, WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
import { parseEther } from "viem";
// you should already have a client set up (prerequisite)
import { client } from "./utils";

async function main() {
  const response = await client.license.registerPILTerms(
    PILFlavor.commercialRemix({
      commercialRevShare: 5,
      defaultMintingFee: parseEther("1"), // 1 $IP
      currency: WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    })
  );

  console.log(
    `PIL Terms registered at transaction hash ${response.txHash}, License Terms ID: ${response.licenseTermsId}`
  );
}

main();
```

## 3. Attach License Terms

Now that we have created terms and have the associated `licenseTermsId`, we can attach them to an existing IP Asset like so:

<Info>
  Associated Docs:
  [license.attachLicenseTerms](/sdk-reference/license#attachlicenseterms)
</Info>

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { LicenseTerms } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
import { zeroAddress } from "viem";
// you should already have a client set up (prerequisite)
import { client } from "./utils";

async function main() {
  // previous code here ...

  const response = await client.license.attachLicenseTerms({
    // insert your newly created license terms id here
    licenseTermsId: LICENSE_TERMS_ID,
    // insert the ipId you want to attach terms to here
    ipId: "0x4c1f8c1035a8cE379dd4ed666758Fb29696CF721",
  });

  if (response.success) {
    console.log(
      `Attached License Terms to IPA at transaction hash ${response.txHash}.`
    );
  } else {
    console.log(`License Terms already attached to this IPA.`);
  }
}

main();
```

## 3. Mint a License

Now that we have attached License Terms to our IP, the next step is minting a License Token, which we'll go over on the next page.
# Mint a License Token

> Learn how to mint a License Token from an IP Asset in TypeScript.

This section demonstrates how to mint a [License Token](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token) from an [IP Asset](/concepts/ip-asset). You can only mint a License Token from an IP Asset if the IP Asset has [License Terms](/concepts/licensing-module/license-terms) attached to it. A License Token is minted as an ERC-721.

There are two reasons you'd mint a License Token:

1. To hold the license and be able to use the underlying IP Asset as the license described (for ex. "Can use commercially as long as you provide proper attribution and share 5% of your revenue)
2. Use the license token to link another IP Asset as a derivative of it. *Note though that, as you'll see later, some SDK functions don't require you to explicitly mint a license token first in order to register a derivative, and will actually handle it for you behind the scenes.*

### Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [TypeScript SDK Setup](/developers/typescript-sdk/setup)
2. An IP Asset that has License Terms added. Learn how to add License Terms to an IPA [here](/developers/typescript-sdk/attach-terms).

## 1. Mint License

Let's say that IP Asset (`ipId = 0x01`) has License Terms (`licenseTermdId = 10`) attached to it. We want to mint 2 License Tokens with those terms to a specific wallet address (`0x02`).

<Warning>
  Be mindful that some IP Assets may have license terms attached that require the user minting the license to pay a `defaultMintingFee`. You can see an example of that in the [TypeScript Tutorial](https://github.com/storyprotocol/typescript-tutorial/blob/main/scripts/derivative/registerDerivativeCommercial.ts).
</Warning>

<Note>
  Note that a license token can only be minted if the `licenseTermsId` are already attached to the IP Asset, making it a publicly available license. The IP owner can, however, mint a [private license](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token#private-licenses) by minting a license token with a `licenseTermsId` that is not attached to the IP Asset.
</Note>

<Info>
  Associated Docs:
  [license.mintLicenseTokens](/sdk-reference/license#mintlicensetokens)
</Info>

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
// you should already have a client set up (prerequisite)
import { client } from "./client";

async function main() {
  const response = await client.license.mintLicenseTokens({
    licenseTermsId: "10",
    licensorIpId: "0x641E638e8FCA4d4844F509630B34c9D524d40BE5",
    receiver: "0x641E638e8FCA4d4844F509630B34c9D524d40BE5", // optional. if not provided, it will go to the tx sender
    amount: 2,
    maxMintingFee: BigInt(0), // disabled
    maxRevenueShare: 100, // default
  });

  console.log(
    `License Token minted at transaction hash ${response.txHash}, License IDs: ${response.licenseTokenIds}`
  );
}

main();
```

### 1a. Setting Restrictions on Minting License Token

This is a note for owners of an IP Asset who want to set restrictions on who or how their license tokens are minted. You can:

* Set a max number of licenses that can be minted
* Charge dynamic fees based on who / how many are minted
* Whitelisted certain wallets to mint the tokens

... and more. Learn more by checking out the [License Config](/concepts/licensing-module/license-config) section of our documentation.

## 2. Register a Derivative

Now that we have minted a License Token, we can hold it or use it to link an IP Asset as a derivative. We will go over that on the next page.

*Note though that, as you'll see later, some SDK functions don't require you to explicitly mint a license token first in order to register a derivative, and will actually handle it for you behind the scenes.*

### 2a. Why would I ever use a License Token if it's not needed?

There are a few times when **you would need** a License Token to register a derivative:

* The License Token contains private license terms, so you would only be able to register as a derivative if you had the License Token that was manually minted by the owner. More on that [here](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token#private-licenses).
* The License Token (which is an NFT) costs a `mintingFee` to mint, and you were able to buy it on a marketplace for a cheaper price. Then it makes more sense to simply register with the License Token then have to pay the more expensive `defaultMintingFee`.
# Claim Revenue

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This section demonstrates how to claim due revenue from an IP Asset.

There are two main ways revenue can be claimed:

1. **Scenario #1**: Someone pays my IP Asset directly, and I claim that revenue.
2. **Scenario #2**: Someone pays a derivative IP Asset of my IP, and I have the right to a % of their revenue based on the `commercialRevShare` in the license terms.

### Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [TypeScript SDK Setup](/developers/typescript-sdk/setup)
2. Have a basic understanding of the [Royalty Module](/concepts/royalty-module)
3. Obviously, there must be a payment to be claimed. Read [Pay an IPA](/developers/typescript-sdk/pay-ipa)

## Before We Start

When payments are made, they eventually end up in an IP Asset's [IP Royalty Vault](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault). From here, they are claimed/transferred to whoever owns the Royalty Tokens associated with it, which represent a % of revenue share for a given IP Asset's IP Royalty Vault.

The IP Account (the smart contract that represents the [IP Asset](/concepts/ip-asset)) is what holds 100% of the Royalty Tokens when it's first registered. So usually, it indeed holds most of the Royalty Tokens.

<Note>
  **Quick Note**. The below scenarios and examples use a [Liquid Absolute Percentage](/concepts/royalty-module/liquid-absolute-percentage) royalty policy. This is currently one of two royalty policies you can use.
</Note>

## Scenario #1

In this scenario, I own IP Asset 3. Someone pays my IP Asset 3 directly, and I claim that revenue. Let's view this in steps:

1. As we can see in the below diagram, when someone pays IP Asset 3 100 \$WIP, 85 \$WIP automatically gets deposited into IP Royalty Vault 3 (based on the license terms, which specifiies a LAP royalty policy and the resulting royalty stack).

2. Now, IP Asset 3 wants to claim its revenue sitting in the IP Royalty Vault 3. It will look like this:

Below is how IP Asset 3 would claim their revenue, as shown in the image above, with the SDK:

<Info>
  Associated Docs:
  [royalty.claimAllRevenue](/sdk-reference/royalty#claimallrevenue)
</Info>

<Note>
  Claiming revenue is permissionless. Any wallet can run the claim revenue transaction for an IP.
</Note>

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
// you should already have a client set up (prerequisite)
import { client } from "./client";

async function main() {
  const claimRevenue = await client.royalty.claimAllRevenue({
    // IP Asset 3's ipId
    ancestorIpId: "0x03",
    // the address that owns the royalty tokens,
    // which is the IP Account in this case
    claimer: "0x03",
    currencyTokens: [WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS],
    childIpIds: [],
    royaltyPolicies: [],
    claimOptions: {
      // If the wallet claiming the revenue is the owner of the
      // IP Account/IP Asset (in other words, the owner of the
      // IP's underlying NFT), `claimAllRevenue` will transfer all
      // earnings to the user's external wallet holding the NFT
      // instead of the IP Account, for convenience. You can disable it here.
      autoTransferAllClaimedTokensFromIp: true,
      // Unwraps the claimed $WIP to $IP for you
      autoUnwrapIpTokens: true,
    },
  });

  console.log(`Claimed revenue: ${claimRevenue.claimedTokens}`);
}

main();
```

## Scenario #2

In this scenario, I own IP Asset 1. Someone pays a derivative IP Asset 3, and I have the right to a % of their revenue based on the `commercialRevShare` in the license terms. This is exactly the same as Scenario #1, except one extra step is added. Let's view this in steps:

1. As we can see in the below diagram, when someone pays IP Asset 3 100 \$WIP, 15 \$WIP automatically gets deposited to the LAP royalty policy contract to be distributed to ancestors.

2. Then, in a second step, the tokens are transferred to the ancestors' [IP Royalty Vault](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault) based on the negotiated `commercialRevShare` in the license terms.

Below is how IP Asset 1 (or 2) would claim their revenue, as shown in the image above, with the SDK:

## Scenario #3

In this scenario, I own IP Asset 1. Someone pays a derivative IP Asset 3, and I have the right to a % of their revenue based on the `commercialRevShare` in the license terms. The difference here is that I have previously transferred the royalty tokens in the IP Account to an external wallet, most commonly the wallet that owns the IP. This is exactly the same as Scenario #2, except royalty is being claimed to an external wallet instead of the IP Account. Let's view this in steps:

1. As we can see in the below diagram, when someone pays IP Asset 3 100 \$WIP, 15 \$WIP automatically gets deposited to the LAP royalty policy contract to be distributed to ancestors.

Below is how IP Asset 1 (or 2) would claim their revenue, as shown in the image above, with the SDK:

# Pay an IPA

This section demonstrates how to pay an IP Asset. There are a few reasons you would do this:

1. You simply want to "tip" an IP
2. You have to because your license terms with an ancestor IP require you to forward a certain % of payment

In either scenario, you would use the below `payRoyaltyOnBehalf` function. When this happens, the [Royalty Module](/concepts/royalty-module) automatically handles the different payment flows such that parent IP Assets who have negotiated a certain `commercialRevShare` with the IPA being paid can claim their due share.

### Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [TypeScript SDK Setup](/developers/typescript-sdk/setup)
2. Have a basic understanding of the [Royalty Module](/concepts/royalty-module)

## Before We Start

You can pay an IP Asset using the `payRoyaltyOnBehalf` function.

You will be paying the IP Asset with [\$WIP](https://aeneid.storyscan.io/address/0x1514000000000000000000000000000000000000). **Note that if you don't have enough \$WIP, the function will auto wrap an equivalent amount of \$IP into \$WIP for you.** If you don't have enough of either, it will fail.

To help with the following scenarios, let's say we have a parent IP Asset that has negotiated a 50% `commercialRevShare` with its child IP Asset.

### Whitelisted Revenue Tokens

Only tokens that are whitelisted by our protocol can be used as payment ("revenue") tokens. \$WIP is one of those tokens. To see that list, go [here](/developers/deployed-smart-contracts#whitelisted-revenue-tokens).

<Tip>
  If you want to test paying IP Assets, you'll probably want a whitelisted revenue token you can mint freely for testing. We have provided [MockERC20](https://aeneid.storyscan.io/address/0xF2104833d386a2734a4eB3B8ad6FC6812F29E38E?tab=write_contract#0x40c10f19) on Aeneid testnet which you can mint and pay with. Then when you're ready, you should use \$WIP.
</Tip>

## Scenario #1: Tipping an IP Asset

In this scenario, you're an external 3rd-party user who wants to pay an IP Asset 2 \$WIP for being cool. When you call the function below, you should make `payerIpId` a zero address because you are not paying on behalf of an IP Asset. Additionally, you would set `amount` to 2.

<Info>
  Associated Docs:
  [royalty.payRoyaltyOnBehalf](/sdk-reference/royalty#payroyaltyonbehalf)
</Info>

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
// you should already have a client set up (prerequisite)
import { client } from "./utils";
import { zeroAddress, parseEther } from "viem";

async function main() {
  const payRoyalty = await client.royalty.payRoyaltyOnBehalf({
    receiverIpId: "0x0b825D9E5FA196e6B563C0a446e8D9885057f9B1", // the ip you're paying
    payerIpId: zeroAddress,
    token: WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    amount: parseEther("2"), // 2 $WIP
  });

  console.log(`Paid royalty at transaction hash ${payRoyalty.txHash}`);
}

main();
```

Let's say the IP Asset you're paying is a derivative. And due to existing license terms with a parent that specify 50% `commercialRevShare`, 50% of the revenue (2\*0.5 = 1) would automatically be claimable by the parent thanks to the [Royalty Module](/concepts/royalty-module), such that both the parent and child IP Assets earn 1 \$WIP. We'll go over this on the next page.

## Scenario #2: Paying Due Share

In this scenario, lets say a derivative IP Asset earned 2 USD off-chain. Because the derivative owes the parent IP Asset 50% of its revenue, it could give the parent 1 USD off-chain and be ok. Or, it can send 1 \$USD equivalent to the parent on-chain *(for this example, let's just assume 1 \$WIP = 1 USD)*.

<Info>
  Associated Docs:
  [royalty.payRoyaltyOnBehalf](/sdk-reference/royalty#payroyaltyonbehalf)
</Info>

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
// you should already have a client set up (prerequisite)
import { client } from "./utils";
import { parseEther } from "viem";

async function main() {
  const payRoyalty = await client.royalty.payRoyaltyOnBehalf({
    receiverIpId: "0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2", // parentIpId
    payerIpId: "0x0b825D9E5FA196e6B563C0a446e8D9885057f9B1", // childIpId
    token: WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    amount: parseEther("1"), // 1 $WIP
  });

  console.log(`Paid royalty at transaction hash ${payRoyalty.txHash}`);
}

main();
```

### Complex Royalty Graphs

Let's say the child earned 1,000 USD off-chain, and is linked to a huge ancestor tree where each parent has a different set of complex license terms. In this scenario, you won't be able to individually calculate each payment to each parent. Instead, you would just pay *yourself* the amount you earned, and the [Royalty Module](/concepts/royalty-module) will automate the payment, such that each ancestor gets their due share.

This section demonstrates how to dispute an IP on Story. There are many instances where you may want to dispute an IP - whether that IP is or is not owned by you. Disputing IP on Story is easy thanks to our [Dispute Module](/concepts/dispute-module) and the [UMA Arbitration Policy](/concepts/dispute-module/uma-arbitration-policy).

Let's say you register a drawing, and then someone else registers that drawing with 1 pixel off. You can dispute it along a `IMPROPER_REGISTRATION` tag, which communicates potential plagiarism.

In this tutorial, you will simply learn how to flag an IP as being disputed.

### Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [TypeScript SDK Setup](/developers/typescript-sdk/setup)
2. Have a basic understanding of the [Dispute Module](/concepts/dispute-module)

## 1. Dispute an IP

To dispute an IP Asset, you will need:

* The `targetIpId` of the IP Asset you are disputing (we use a test one below)
* The `targetTag` that you are applying to the dispute. Only [whitelisted tags](/concepts/dispute-module/overview#dispute-tags) can be applied.
* A `cid` (Content Identifier) is a unique identifier in IPFS that represents the dispute evidence you must provide, as described [here](/concepts/dispute-module/uma-arbitration-policy#dispute-evidence-submission-guidelines) (we use a test one below).

<Warning>
  **Note you can only provide a CID one time.** After it is used, it can't be
  used as evidence again.
</Warning>

Create a `main.ts` file and add the code below:

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { client } from "./utils";
import { parseEther } from "viem";
import { DisputeTargetTag } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";

async function main() {
  const disputeResponse = await client.dispute.raiseDispute({
    targetIpId: "0x6b42d065aDCDA6fA83B59ad731841360dC5321fB",
    // NOTE: you must use your own CID here, because every time it is used,
    // the protocol does not allow you to use it again
    cid: "QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnR",
    // you must pick from one of the whitelisted tags here: https://docs.story.foundation/concepts/dispute-module#dispute-tags
    targetTag: DisputeTargetTag.IMPROPER_REGISTRATION,
    bond: parseEther("0.1"), // minimum of 0.1
    liveness: 2592000,
  });
  console.log(
    `Dispute raised at transaction hash ${disputeResponse.txHash}, Dispute ID: ${disputeResponse.disputeId}`
  );
}

main();
```

# Setup

> Set up your development environment for Story smart contracts.

In this guide, we will show you how to setup the Story smart contract development environment in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

* [Install Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
* [Install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Creating a Project

1. Run `foundryup` to automatically install the latest stable version of the precompiled binaries: forge, cast, anvil, and chisel
2. Run the following command in a new directory: `forge init`. This will create a `foundry.toml` and example project files in the project root. By default, forge init will also initialize a new git repository.
3. Initialize a new yarn project: `yarn init`. (⚠️ Note: Only Yarn is compatible with the packages used in this project. Using `npm` or `pnpm` may result in dependency conflicts.)
4. Open up your root-level `foundry.toml` file (located in the top directory of your project) and replace it with this:

```toml  theme={null}
[profile.default]
out = 'out'
libs = ['node_modules', 'lib']
cache_path  = 'forge-cache'
gas_reports = ["*"]
optimizer = true
optimizer_runs = 20000
test = 'test'
solc = '0.8.26'
fs_permissions = [{ access = 'read', path = './out' }, { access = 'read-write', path = './deploy-out' }]
evm_version = 'cancun'
remappings = [
    '@openzeppelin/=node_modules/@openzeppelin/',
    '@storyprotocol/core/=node_modules/@story-protocol/protocol-core/contracts/',
    '@storyprotocol/periphery/=node_modules/@story-protocol/protocol-periphery/contracts/',
    'erc6551/=node_modules/erc6551/',
    'forge-std/=node_modules/forge-std/src/',
    'ds-test/=node_modules/ds-test/src/',
    '@storyprotocol/test/=node_modules/@story-protocol/protocol-core/test/foundry/',
    '@solady/=node_modules/solady/'
]
```

5. Remove the example contract files: `rm src/Counter.sol script/Counter.s.sol test/Counter.t.sol`

## Installing Dependencies

Now, we are ready to start installing our dependencies. To incorporate the Story Protocol core and periphery modules, run the following to have them added to your `package.json`. We will also install `openzeppelin` and `erc6551` as a dependency for the contract and test.

```bash  theme={null}
# note: you can run them one-by-one, or all at once
yarn add @story-protocol/protocol-core@https://github.com/storyprotocol/protocol-core-v1
yarn add @story-protocol/protocol-periphery@https://github.com/storyprotocol/protocol-periphery-v1
yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts
yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable
yarn add erc6551
yarn add solady
```

Additionally, for working with Foundry's test kit, we also recommend adding the following `devDependencies`:

```bash  theme={null}
yarn add -D https://github.com/dapphub/ds-test
yarn add -D github:foundry-rs/forge-std#v1.7.6
```

Now we are ready to build a simple test registration contract!

# Writing the Smart Contract

Now that we have walked through each of the individual steps, let's try to write, deploy, and verify our own smart contract.

## Register IPA, Register License Terms, and Attach to IPA

In this first section, we will combine a few of the tutorials into one. We will create a function named `mintAndRegisterAndCreateTermsAndAttach` that allows you to mint & register a new IP Asset, register new License Terms, and attach those terms to an IP Asset. It will also accept a `receiver` field to be the owner of the new IP Asset.

### Prerequisites

* Complete [Register an IP Asset](/developers/smart-contracts-guide/register-ip-asset)
* Complete [Register License Terms](/developers/smart-contracts-guide/register-terms)
* Complete [Attach Terms to an IPA](/developers/smart-contracts-guide/attach-terms)

### Writing our Contract

Create a new file under `./src/Example.sol` and paste the following:

<Note>
  **Contract Addresses**

  In order to get the contract addresses to pass in the constructor, go to [Deployed Smart Contracts](/developers/deployed-smart-contracts).

  function mintAndRegisterAndCreateTermsAndAttach(
    address receiver
  ) external returns (uint256 tokenId, address ipId, uint256 licenseTermsId) {
    // We mint to this contract so that it has permissions
    // to attach license terms to the IP Asset.
    // We will later transfer it to the intended `receiver`
    tokenId = SIMPLE_NFT.mint(address(this));
    ipId = IP_ASSET_REGISTRY.register(block.chainid, address(SIMPLE_NFT), tokenId);

    // register license terms so we can attach them later
    licenseTermsId = PIL_TEMPLATE.registerLicenseTerms(
      PILFlavors.commercialRemix({
        mintingFee: 0,
        commercialRevShare: 10 * 10 ** 6, // 10%
        royaltyPolicy: ROYALTY_POLICY_LAP,
        currencyToken: WIP
      })
    );

    // attach the license terms to the IP Asset
    LICENSING_MODULE.attachLicenseTerms(ipId, address(PIL_TEMPLATE), licenseTermsId);

    // transfer the NFT to the receiver so it owns the IPA
    SIMPLE_NFT.transferFrom(address(this), receiver, tokenId);
  }
}
```

## Mint a License Token and Register as Derivative

In this next section, we will combine a few of the later tutorials into one. We will create a function named `mintLicenseTokenAndRegisterDerivative` that allows a potentially different user to register their own "child" (derivative) IP Asset, mint a License Token from the "parent" (root) IP Asset, and register their child IPA as a derivative of the parent IPA. It will accept a few parameters:

1. `parentIpId`: the `ipId` of the parent IPA
2. `licenseTermsId`: the id of the License Terms you want to mint a License Token for
3. `receiver`: the owner of the child IPA

### Prerequisites

* Complete [Mint a License Token](/developers/smart-contracts-guide/mint-license)
* Complete [Register a Derivative](/developers/smart-contracts-guide/register-derivative)

### Writing our Contract

In your `Example.sol` contract, add the following function at the bottom:

```solidity src/Example.sol theme={null}
/// @notice Mint and register a new child IPA, mint a License Token
/// from the parent, and register it as a derivative of the parent.
/// @param parentIpId The ipId of the parent IPA.
/// @param licenseTermsId The ID of the license terms you will
/// mint a license token from.
/// @param receiver The address that will receive the NFT/IPA.
/// @return childTokenId The token ID of the NFT representing ownership of the child IPA.
/// @return childIpId The address of the child IPA.
function mintLicenseTokenAndRegisterDerivative(
  address parentIpId,
  uint256 licenseTermsId,
  address receiver
) external returns (uint256 childTokenId, address childIpId) {
  // We mint to this contract so that it has permissions
  // to register itself as a derivative of another
  // IP Asset.
  // We will later transfer it to the intended `receiver`
  childTokenId = SIMPLE_NFT.mint(address(this));
  childIpId = IP_ASSET_REGISTRY.register(block.chainid, address(SIMPLE_NFT), childTokenId);

  // mint a license token from the parent
  uint256 licenseTokenId = LICENSING_MODULE.mintLicenseTokens({
    licensorIpId: parentIpId,
    licenseTemplate: address(PIL_TEMPLATE),
    licenseTermsId: licenseTermsId,
    amount: 1,
    // mint the license token to this contract so it can
    // use it to register as a derivative of the parent
    receiver: address(this),
    royaltyContext: "", // for PIL, royaltyContext is empty string
    maxMintingFee: 0,
    maxRevenueShare: 0
  });

  uint256[] memory licenseTokenIds = new uint256[](1);
  licenseTokenIds[0] = licenseTokenId;

  // register the new child IPA as a derivative
  // of the parent
  LICENSING_MODULE.registerDerivativeWithLicenseTokens({
    childIpId: childIpId,
    licenseTokenIds: licenseTokenIds,
    royaltyContext: "", // empty for PIL
    maxRts: 0
  });

  // transfer the NFT to the receiver so it owns the child IPA
  SIMPLE_NFT.transferFrom(address(this), receiver, childTokenId);
}
```

# Testing our Contract

Run `forge build`. If everything is successful, the command should successfully compile.

To test this out, simply run the following command:

```bash  theme={null}
forge test --fork-url https://aeneid.storyrpc.io/ --match-path test/Example.t.sol
```

# Deploy & Verify the Example Contract

The `--constructor-args` come from [Deployed Smart Contracts](/developers/deployed-smart-contracts).

```bash  theme={null}
forge create \
  --rpc-url https://aeneid.storyrpc.io/ \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  ./src/Example.sol:Example \
  --legacy \
  --verify \

```

If everything worked correctly, you should see something like `Deployed to: 0xfb0923D531C1ca54AB9ee10CB8364b23d0C7F47d` in the console. Paste that address into [the explorer](https://aeneid.storyscan.io/) and see your verified contract!

# Register an IP Asset

> Learn how to Register an NFT as an IP Asset in Solidity.

  Follow the completed code all the way through.
</Card>

Let's say you have some off-chain IP (ex. a book, a character, a drawing, etc). In order to register that IP on Story, you first need to mint an NFT. This NFT is the **ownership** over the IP. Then you **register** that NFT on Story, turning it into an [IP Asset](/concepts/ip-asset/overview). The below tutorial will walk you through how to do this.

## Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [Setup Your Own Project](/developers/smart-contracts-guide/setup)

## Before We Start

There are two scenarios:

1. You already have a **custom** ERC-721 NFT contract and can mint from it
2. You want to create an [SPG (Periphery)](/concepts/spg/overview) NFT contract to do minting for you

## Scenario #1: You already have a custom ERC-721 NFT contract and can mint from it

If you already have an NFT minted, or you want to register IP using a custom-built ERC-721 contract, this is the section for you.

As you can see below, the registration process is relatively straightforward. We use `SimpleNFT` as an example, but you can replace it with your own ERC-721 contract.

All you have to do is call `register` on the [IP Asset Registry](/concepts/registry/ip-asset-registry) with:

* `chainid` - you can simply use `block.chainid`
* `tokenContract` - the address of your NFT collection
* `tokenId` - your NFT's ID

Let's create a test file under `test/0_IPARegistrar.t.sol` to see it work and verify the results:

<Note>
  **Contract Addresses**

  We have filled in the addresses from the Story contracts for you. However you can also find the addresses for them here: [Deployed Smart Contracts](/developers/deployed-smart-contracts)

  You can view the `SimpleNFT` contract we're using to test [here](https://github.com/storyprotocol/story-protocol-boilerplate/blob/main/src/mocks/SimpleNFT.sol).
</Note>

    address internal alice = address(0xa11ce);

    // For addresses, see https://docs.story.foundation/developers/deployed-smart-contracts
    // Protocol Core - IPAssetRegistry
    IIPAssetRegistry internal IP_ASSET_REGISTRY = IIPAssetRegistry(0x77319B4031e6eF1250907aa00018B8B1c67a244b);

    SimpleNFT public SIMPLE_NFT;

    function setUp() public {
        // Create a new Simple NFT collection
        SIMPLE_NFT = new SimpleNFT("Simple IP NFT", "SIM");
    }

    /// @notice Mint an NFT and then register it as an IP Asset.
    function test_register() public {
        uint256 expectedTokenId = SIMPLE_NFT.nextTokenId();
        address expectedIpId = IP_ASSET_REGISTRY.ipId(block.chainid, address(SIMPLE_NFT), expectedTokenId);

        uint256 tokenId = SIMPLE_NFT.mint(alice);
        address ipId = IP_ASSET_REGISTRY.register(block.chainid, address(SIMPLE_NFT), tokenId);

        assertEq(tokenId, expectedTokenId);
        assertEq(ipId, expectedIpId);
        assertEq(SIMPLE_NFT.ownerOf(tokenId), alice);
    }
}
```

## Scenario #2: You want to create an SPG NFT contract to do minting for you

If you don't have your own custom NFT contract, this is the section for you.

To achieve this, we will be using the [SPG](/concepts/spg/overview), which is a utility contract that allows us to combine multiple transactions into one. In this case, we'll be using the SPG's `mintAndRegisterIp` function which combines both minting an NFT and registering it as an IP Asset.

In order to use `mintAndRegisterIp`, we first have to create a new `SPGNFT` collection. We can do this simply by calling `createCollection` on the `StoryProtocolGateway` contract. Or, if you want to create your own `SPGNFT` for some reason, you can implement the [ISPGNFT](https://github.com/storyprotocol/protocol-periphery-v1/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/ISPGNFT.sol) contract interface. Follow the example below to see example parameters you can use to initialize a new SPGNFT.

Once you have your own SPGNFT, all you have to do is call `mintAndRegisterIp` with:

* `spgNftContract` - the address of your SPGNFT contract
* `recipient` - the address of who will receive the NFT and thus be the owner of the newly registered IP. *Note: remember that registering IP on Story is permissionless, so you can register an IP for someone else (by paying for the transaction) yet they can still be the owner of that IP Asset.*
* `ipMetadata` - the metadata associated with your NFT & IP. See [this](/concepts/ip-asset/overview#nft-vs-ip-metadata) section to better understand setting NFT & IP metadata.

1. Run `touch test/0_IPARegistrar.t.sol` to create a test file under `test/0_IPARegistrar.t.sol`. Then, paste in the following code:

[License Terms](/concepts/licensing-module/license-terms) are a configurable set of values that define restrictions on licenses minted from your IP that have those terms. For example, "If you mint this license, you must share 50% of your revenue with me." You can view the full set of terms in [PIL Terms](/concepts/programmable-ip-license/pil-terms).

## Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [Setup Your Own Project](/developers/smart-contracts-guide/setup)

## Before We Start

It's important to know that if **License Terms already exist for the identical set of parameters you intend to create, it is unnecessary to create it again**. License Terms are protocol-wide, so you can use existing License Terms by its `licenseTermsId`.

### PIL Flavors

As you see above, you have to choose between a lot of terms.

We have convenience functions to help you register new terms. We have created [PIL Flavors](/concepts/programmable-ip-license/pil-flavors), which are pre-configured popular combinations of License Terms to help you decide what terms to use. You can view those PIL Flavors and then register terms using the following convenience functions:

This section demonstrates how to attach [License Terms](/concepts/licensing-module/license-terms) to an [IP Asset](/concepts/ip-asset/overview). By attaching terms, users can publicly mint [License Tokens](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token) (the on-chain "license") with those terms from the IP.

## Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [Setup Your Own Project](/developers/smart-contracts-guide/setup)
2. Create License Terms and have a `licenseTermsId`. You can do that by following the [previous page](/developers/smart-contracts-guide/register-terms).

## Attach License Terms

Now that we have created terms and have the associated `licenseTermsId`, we can attach them to an existing IP Asset.

This section demonstrates how to mint a [License Token](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token) from an [IP Asset](/concepts/ip-asset/overview). You can only mint a License Token from an IP Asset if the IP Asset has [License Terms](/concepts/licensing-module/license-terms) attached to it. A License Token is minted as an ERC-721.

There are two reasons you'd mint a License Token:

1. To hold the license and be able to use the underlying IP Asset as the license described (for ex. "Can use commercially as long as you provide proper attribution and share 5% of your revenue)
2. Use the license token to link another IP Asset as a derivative of it. *Note though that, as you'll see later, some SDK functions don't require you to explicitly mint a license token first in order to register a derivative, and will actually handle it for you behind the scenes.*

## Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [Setup Your Own Project](/developers/smart-contracts-guide/setup)
2. An IP Asset has License Terms attached to it. You can learn how to do that [here](/developers/smart-contracts-guide/attach-terms)

## Mint License

Let's say that IP Asset (`ipId = 0x01`) has License Terms (`licenseTermdId = 10`) attached to it. We want to mint 2 License Tokens with those terms to a specific wallet address (`0x02`).

<Warning>
  **Paid Licenses**

  Be mindful that some IP Assets may have license terms attached that require the user minting the license to pay a `mintingFee`.
</Warning>

Let's create a test file under `test/3_LicenseToken.t.sol` to see it work and verify the results:

# Pay & Claim Revenue

> Learn how to pay an IP Asset and claim revenue in Solidity.

  Follow the completed code all the way through.
</Card>

This section demonstrates how to pay an IP Asset. There are a few reasons you would do this:

1. You simply want to "tip" an IP
2. You have to because your license terms with an ancestor IP require you to forward a certain % of payment

In either scenario, you would use the below `payRoyaltyOnBehalf` function. When this happens, the [Royalty Module](/concepts/royalty-module/overview) automatically handles the different payment flows such that parent IP Assets who have negotiated a certain `commercialRevShare` with the IPA being paid can claim their due share.

## Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [Setup Your Own Project](/developers/smart-contracts-guide/setup)
2. Have a basic understanding of the [Royalty Module](/concepts/royalty-module/overview)
3. A child IPA and a parent IPA, for which their license terms have a commercial revenue share to make this example work

## Before We Start

You can pay an IP Asset using the `payRoyaltyOnBehalf` function from the [Royalty Module](/concepts/royalty-module/overview).

You will be paying the IP Asset with [MockERC20](https://aeneid.storyscan.io/address/0xF2104833d386a2734a4eB3B8ad6FC6812F29E38E). Usually you would pay with \$WIP, but because we need to mint some tokens to test, we will use MockERC20.

To help with the following scenarios, let's say we have a parent IP Asset that has negotiated a 50% `commercialRevShare` with its child IP Asset.

### Whitelisted Revenue Tokens

Only tokens that are whitelisted by our protocol can be used as payment ("revenue") tokens. MockERC20 is one of those tokens. To see that list, go [here](/developers/deployed-smart-contracts#whitelisted-revenue-tokens).

## Paying an IP Asset

We can pay an IP Asset like so:

```solidity Solidity theme={null}
ROYALTY_MODULE.payRoyaltyOnBehalf(childIpId, address(0), address(MERC20), 10);
```

This will send 10 \$MERC20 to the `childIpId`'s [IP Royalty Vault](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault). From there, the child can claim revenue. In the next section, you'll see a working version of this.

<Warning>
  **Important: Approving the Royalty Module**

  Before you call `payRoyaltyOnBehalf`, you have to approve the royalty module to spend the tokens for you. In the section below, you will see that we call `MERC20.approve(address(ROYALTY_MODULE), 10);` or else it will not work.
</Warning>

## Claim Revenue

When payments are made, they eventually end up in an IP Asset's [IP Royalty Vault](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault). From here, they are claimed/transferred to whoever owns the Royalty Tokens associated with it, which represent a % of revenue share for a given IP Asset's IP Royalty Vault.

The IP Account (the smart contract that represents the [IP Asset](/concepts/ip-asset/overview)) is what holds 100% of the Royalty Tokens when it's first registered. So usually, it indeed holds most of the Royalty Tokens.

Let's create a test file under `test/5_Royalty.t.sol` to see it work and verify the results:

# Cross-Chain License Minting

> A guide on how to set up cross-chain license minting using deBridge.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use [deBridge](https://docs.debridge.finance/) to perform cross-chain license minting. For this tutorial specifically, we'll be using Base \$ETH to mint a license on Story.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Base Example" icon="computer" color="#0000fe" href="https://github.com/jacob-tucker/base-story-quickstart">
    A working code example of minting a license on Story using Base \$ETH.

    A working code example of minting a license on Story using Abstract \$ETH.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

From a high level, it involves:

1. Constructing a deBridge API call that will return tx data to swap tokens across chains and perform some action (e.g. mint a license on Story)
2. Executing the API call to receive that tx data
3. Executing the transaction (using the returned tx data) on the source chain

## Step 1: Constructing the deBridge API Call

The first step is to construct a deBridge API call. The purpose of this API call is to receive back a response that will contain transaction data so we can then execute it on the source chain.

This deBridge order swaps tokens from one chain to another. We can also optionally attach a `dlnHook` that will execute an arbitrary action upon order completion (ex. after \$ETH has been swapped for \$IP). This is where the magic happens.

<Note>
  You can learn more about dlnHooks [here](https://docs.debridge.finance/dln-the-debridge-liquidity-network-protocol/integration-guidelines/interacting-with-the-api).
</Note>

In this case, the `dlnHook` will be a call to `mintLicenseTokensCrossChain`, which is a function [in this contract](https://www.storyscan.io/address/0x6429A616F76a8958e918145d64bf7681C3936D6A?tab=contract) that wraps the received \$IP to \$WIP and then mints a license token on Story.

You can see that `mintLicenseTokensCrossChain` looks like this:

```solidity DebridgeLicenseTokenMinter.sol expandable theme={null}
function mintLicenseTokensCrossChain(
    address licensorIpId,
    uint256 licenseTermsId,
    uint256 tokenAmount,
    address receiver
) external payable {
  uint256 amount = msg.value;
  require(amount > 0, "DebridgeLicenseTokenMinter: zero amount");

  // Create multicall data - using memory array directly to avoid stack issues
  IMulticall.Call3Value[] memory calls = new IMulticall.Call3Value[](2);

  // First call: deposit IP to get WIP tokens
  calls[0] = IMulticall.Call3Value({
      target: WIP,
      allowFailure: false,
      value: amount,
      callData: abi.encodeWithSelector(IWrappedIP.deposit.selector)
  });

  // Second call: mint license tokens
  calls[1] = IMulticall.Call3Value({
      target: LICENSING_MODULE,
      allowFailure: false,
      value: 0,
      callData: abi.encodeWithSelector(
          ILicensingModule.mintLicenseTokens.selector,
          licensorIpId,
          PIL_TEMPLATE,
          licenseTermsId,
          tokenAmount,
          receiver,
          "",
          0,
          100_000_000
      )
  });

  // Execute multicall and emit event
  IMulticall.Result[] memory returnData = IMulticall(MULTICALL).aggregate3Value{ value: amount }(calls);
  bytes memory raw = returnData[1].returnData;
  uint256 startLicenseTokenId = abi.decode(raw, (uint256)); // if mintLicenseTokens returns uint256
  emit LicenseTokensMinted(licensorIpId, receiver, startLicenseTokenId, tokenAmount);
}
```

You may be wondering, *"where does it `approve` the Royalty Module (what pays for the license minting fee) to spend the \$WIP?"* This is already done for you, since the Royalty Module is already approved to spend on behalf of Multicall.

The reason we had to make a Multicall contract in the first place, instead of simply bridging directly to \$WIP and calling `mintLicenseTokens` in the Licensing Module, is because the Royalty Module wouldn't be approved to spend the \$WIP. So we utilize the Multicall contract to take care of that for us instead.

<Tip>
  To summarize, we will construct a deBridge API call that says *"we want to swap \$ETH for \$IP, then use a dlnHook to call a smart contract on Story that wraps \$IP to \$WIP and mints a license on Story".*
</Tip>

### Step 1a. Constructing the `dlnHook`

The `dlnHook` is a JSON object that will be attached to the deBridge API call. It will contain the following information:

* The type of action to execute (`evm_transaction_call`)
* The address of the contract to call (`DebridgeLicenseTokenMinter.sol`)
* The calldata to execute (`mintLicenseTokensCrossChain`)

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
const STORY_WRAP_THEN_LICENSE_MULTICALL =
  "0x6429a616f76a8958e918145d64bf7681c3936d6a";

// Build the dlnHook for Story royalty payment
const buildRoyaltyPaymentHook = ({ ipId: `0x${string}`, licenseTermsId: bigint, receiverAddress: `0x${string}` }): string => {
  // Encode the mintLicenseTokensCrossChain function call
  const calldata = encodeFunctionData({
    abi: [
      {
        name: "mintLicenseTokensCrossChain",
        type: "function",
        inputs: [
          { name: "licensorIpId", type: "address" },
          { name: "licenseTermsId", type: "uint256" },
          { name: "tokenAmount", type: "uint256" },
          { name: "receiver", type: "address" },
        ],
      },
    ],
    functionName: "mintLicenseTokensCrossChain",
    args: [
      ipId,
      licenseTermsId,
      BigInt(1),
      receiverAddress,
    ],
  });

  // Build the dlnHook JSON
  const dlnHook = {
    type: "evm_transaction_call",
    data: {
      to: STORY_WRAP_THEN_LICENSE_MULTICALL,
      calldata: calldata,
      gas: 0,
    },
  };

  return JSON.stringify(dlnHook);
};
```

### Step 1b. Constructing the deBridge API Call

Now that we have the `dlnHook`, we can construct the whole deBridge API call, including the `dlnHook`.

<Note>
  You can view deBridge's documentation on the `create-tx` endpoint [here](https://docs.debridge.finance/dln-the-debridge-liquidity-network-protocol/integration-guidelines/interacting-with-the-api/creating-an-order). I also highly recommend checking out the [Swagger UI](https://dln.debridge.finance/v1.0#/DLN/DlnOrderControllerV10_createOrder) for the `create-tx` endpoint as well.

## Step 2: Executing the API Call

Once the API call is constructed, execute it to receive a response. This response includes transaction data and an estimate for running the transaction on the source swap chain (e.g., Ethereum, Solana).

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript main.ts theme={null}
  // ... previous code here ...

  const getDeBridgeTransactionData = async ({
    ipId: `0x${string}`,
    licenseTermsId: bigint,
    receiverAddress: `0x${string}`,
    senderAddress: `0x${string}`,
    paymentAmount: string // should be in wei
  }): Promise<DeBridgeApiResponse> => {
    try {
      const apiUrl = buildDeBridgeApiUrl({ ipId, licenseTermsId, receiverAddress, senderAddress, paymentAmount });

      const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
          Accept: "application/json",
        },
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(
          `deBridge API error: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`
        );
      }

      const data = (await response.json()) as DeBridgeApiResponse;

      // Validate the response
      if (!data.tx || !data.estimation || !data.orderId) {
        throw new Error("Invalid deBridge API response: missing required fields");

      return data;

## Step 3: Executing the Transaction on the Source Chain

Next, you would take the API response and execute the transaction on the source chain.

  licenseTermsId: BigInt(27910),
  receiverAddress: "0x01", // replace with the address that should receive the license on Story
  senderAddress: account.address,
  paymentAmount: parseEther("0.00001"), // 0.00001 $WIP since the license on Story costs 0.00001 $WIP
};

// Execute the function to send the transaction
executeLicenseMint(params);
```

# Cross-Chain Royalty Payments

> A guide on how to set up cross-chain royalty payments using deBridge.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use [deBridge](https://docs.debridge.finance/) to perform cross-chain royalty payments. For this tutorial specifically, we'll pay an IP Asset on Story using Base \$ETH.

From a high level, it involves:

1. Constructing a deBridge API call that will return tx data to swap tokens across chains and perform some action (e.g. pay royalty to an IP Asset on Story)
2. Executing the API call to receive that tx data
3. Executing the transaction (using the returned tx data) on the source chain

## Step 1: Constructing the deBridge API Call

The first step is to construct a deBridge API call. The purpose of this API call is to receive back a response that will contain transaction data so we can then execute it on the source chain.

This deBridge order swaps tokens from one chain to another. We can also optionally attach a `dlnHook` that will execute an arbitrary action upon order completion (ex. after \$ETH has been swapped for \$WIP). This is where the magic happens.

<Note>
  You can learn more about dlnHooks [here](https://docs.debridge.finance/dln-the-debridge-liquidity-network-protocol/integration-guidelines/interacting-with-the-api).
</Note>

In this case, the `dlnHook` will be a call to `payRoyaltyOnBehalf`, which is a function [in this contract](https://www.storyscan.io/address/0xD2f60c40fEbccf6311f8B47c4f2Ec6b040400086?tab=contract) that pays royalties to an IP Asset on Story.

You may be wondering, *"where does the Royalty Module (the contract spending the tokens on Story) get approved to spend the \$WIP?"* The answer is that deBridge automatically handles token approvals for you using their `IExternalCallExecutor`, where it approves the target address to spend the tokens on the destination chain. In this case because the target address is the Royalty Module itself, token approval is handled for us without having to create a custom multicall contract like we do in the [cross-chain license minting](/developers/tutorials/cross-chain-license-mint) tutorial.

<Note>
  You can learn more about the `IExternalCallExecutor` [here](https://docs.debridge.finance/dln-the-debridge-liquidity-network-protocol/protocol-specs/hook-data/anatomy-of-a-hook-for-the-evm-based-chains#universal-hook).
</Note>

<Tip>
  To summarize, we will construct a deBridge API call that says *"we want to swap \$ETH for \$IP, then use a dlnHook to call a smart contract on Story that pays royalties to an IP Asset on Story".*
</Tip>

### Step 1a. Constructing the `dlnHook`

The `dlnHook` is a JSON object that will be attached to the deBridge API call. It will contain the following information:

* The type of action to execute (`evm_transaction_call`)
* The address of the contract to call (`RoyaltyModule.sol`)
* The calldata to execute (`payRoyaltyOnBehalf`)

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
const ROYALTY_MODULE =
  "0xD2f60c40fEbccf6311f8B47c4f2Ec6b040400086";

// Build the dlnHook for Story royalty payment
const buildRoyaltyPaymentHook = ({ ipId: `0x${string}`, amount: bigint }): string => {
  // Encode the payRoyaltyOnBehalf function call
  const calldata = encodeFunctionData({
    abi: [
      {
        name: "payRoyaltyOnBehalf",
        type: "function",
        inputs: [
          { name: "receiverIpId", type: "address" },
          { name: "payerIpId", type: "address" },
          { name: "token", type: "address" },
          { name: "amount", type: "uint256" },
        ],
      },
    ],
    functionName: "payRoyaltyOnBehalf",
    args: [
      ipId,
      zeroAddress, // because it's not coming from another IP Asset. It's coming from an external address.
      WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
      amount,
    ],
  });

  // Build the dlnHook JSON
  const dlnHook = {
    type: "evm_transaction_call",
    data: {
      to: ROYALTY_MODULE,
      calldata: calldata,
      gas: 0,
    },
  };

  return JSON.stringify(dlnHook);
};
```

### Step 1b. Constructing the deBridge API Call

Now that we have the `dlnHook`, we can construct the whole deBridge API call, including the `dlnHook`.

<Note>
  You can view deBridge's documentation on the `create-tx` endpoint [here](https://docs.debridge.finance/dln-the-debridge-liquidity-network-protocol/integration-guidelines/interacting-with-the-api/creating-an-order). I also highly recommend checking out the [Swagger UI](https://dln.debridge.finance/v1.0#/DLN/DlnOrderControllerV10_createOrder) for the `create-tx` endpoint as well.

  return url;
};
```

## Step 2: Executing the API Call

Once the API call is constructed, execute it to receive a response. This response includes transaction data and an estimate for running the transaction on the source swap chain (e.g., Ethereum, Solana).

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript main.ts theme={null}
  // ... previous code here ...

  const getDeBridgeTransactionData = async ({
    ipId: `0x${string}`,
    senderAddress: `0x${string}`,
    paymentAmount: string // should be in wei
  }): Promise<DeBridgeApiResponse> => {
    try {
      const apiUrl = buildDeBridgeApiUrl({ ipId, senderAddress, paymentAmount });

      const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
          Accept: "application/json",
        },
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(
          `deBridge API error: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`
        );
      }

      const data = (await response.json()) as DeBridgeApiResponse;

      // Validate the response
      if (!data.tx || !data.estimation || !data.orderId) {
        throw new Error("Invalid deBridge API response: missing required fields");
      }

      return data;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error calling deBridge API:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  };
  ```

  ```typescript DeBridgeApiResponse theme={null}
  export interface DeBridgeApiResponse {
    estimation: {
      srcChainTokenIn: {
        amount: string;
        approximateOperatingExpense: string;
      };
      dstChainTokenOut: {
        amount: string;
        maxTheoreticalAmount: string;
      };
    };
    tx: {
      to: string;
      data: string;
      value: string;
    };
    orderId: string;
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 3: Executing the Transaction on the Source Chain

Next, you would take the API response and execute the transaction on the source chain.

<Note>
  View [the docs here](https://docs.debridge.finance/dln-the-debridge-liquidity-network-protocol/integration-guidelines/interacting-with-the-api/submitting-an-order-creation-transaction) on submitting the transaction, including how this would be done differently on Solana.
</Note>

```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
import { base } from "viem/chains";
import { createWalletClient, http, WalletClient, parseEther } from "viem";
import { privateKeyToAccount, Address, Account } from "viem/accounts";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

// Validate environment variables
if (!process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY) {
  throw new Error("WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY is required in .env file");
}

// Create account from private key
const account: Account = privateKeyToAccount(
  `0x${process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY}` as Address
);

// Initialize the wallet client
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: http("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"), // Use Infura or another Ethereum provider
  account,
}) as WalletClient;

// ... previous code here ...

// Function to send a transaction
const executeLicenseMint = async (params: {
  ipId: `0x${string}`;
  senderAddress: `0x${string}`;
  paymentAmount: string; // should be in wei
}) => {
  // Get transaction data from deBridge
  const deBridgeResponse = await getDeBridgeTransactionData(params);

  try {
    // Execute the transaction using the user's wallet
    const txHash = await walletClient.sendTransaction({
      to: deBridgeResponse.tx.to as Address,
      data: deBridgeResponse.tx.data as Address,
      value: BigInt(deBridgeResponse.tx.value),
      account: account as Account,
      chain: base,
    });
    console.log("Transaction sent:", txHash);

    // Wait for the transaction to be mined
    const receipt = await walletClient.waitForTransactionReceipt(txHash);
    console.log("Transaction mined:", receipt.transactionHash);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error sending transaction:", error);
  }
};

// Example usage with a mock API response
const params = {
  ipId: "0xcb6B9CCae4108A103097B30cFc25e1E257D4b5Fe",
  senderAddress: account.address,
  paymentAmount: parseEther("5"), // 5 $WIP
};

// Execute the function to send the transaction
executeLicenseMint(params);
```

# Using the SDK

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Completed Code" href="https://github.com/storyprotocol/typescript-tutorial/blob/main/scripts/royalty/payRevenue.ts" icon="thumbs-up">
    See a completed, working example of setting up a simple derivative chain and
    then tipping the child IP Asset.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

In this tutorial, you will learn how to send money ("tip") an IP Asset using the TypeScript SDK.

## The Explanation

In this scenario, let's say there is a parent IP Asset that represents Mickey Mouse. Someone else draws a hat on that Mickey Mouse and registers it as a derivative (or "child") IP Asset. The License Terms specify that the child must share 50% of all commercial revenue (`commercialRevShare = 50`) with the parent. Someone else (a 3rd party user) comes along and wants to send the derivative 2 \$WIP for being really cool.

For the purposes of this example, we will assume the child is already registered as a derivative IP Asset. If you want help learning this, check out [Register a Derivative](/developers/typescript-sdk/register-derivative).

* Parent IP ID: `0x42595dA29B541770D9F9f298a014bF912655E183`
* Child IP ID: `0xeaa4Eed346373805B377F5a4fe1daeFeFB3D182a`

## 0. Before you Start

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). If you've coded before, you likely have these.
2. Add your Story Network Testnet wallet's private key to `.env` file:

```text env theme={null}
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

3. Add your preferred RPC URL to your `.env` file. You can just use the public default one we provide:

```text env theme={null}
RPC_PROVIDER_URL=https://aeneid.storyrpc.io
```

4. Install the dependencies:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
npm install @story-protocol/core-sdk viem
```

## 1. Set up your Story Config

In a `utils.ts` file, add the following code to set up your Story Config:

* Associated docs: [TypeScript SDK Setup](/developers/typescript-sdk/setup)

```typescript utils.ts theme={null}
import { StoryClient, StoryConfig } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
import { http } from "viem";
import { privateKeyToAccount, Address, Account } from "viem/accounts";

const privateKey: Address = `0x${process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY}`;
export const account: Account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);

const config: StoryConfig = {
  account: account,
  transport: http(process.env.RPC_PROVIDER_URL),
  chainId: "aeneid",
};
export const client = StoryClient.newClient(config);
```

## 2. Tipping the Derivative IP Asset

Now create a `main.ts` file. We will use the `payRoyaltyOnBehalf` function to pay the derivative asset.

You will be paying the IP Asset with [\$WIP](https://aeneid.storyscan.io/address/0x1514000000000000000000000000000000000000). **Note that if you don't have enough \$WIP, the function will auto wrap an equivalent amount of \$IP into \$WIP for you.** If you don't have enough of either, it will fail.

<Note>
  **Whitelisted Revenue Tokens**

  Only tokens that are whitelisted by our protocol can be used as payment ("revenue") tokens. \$WIP is one of those tokens. To see that list, go [here](/developers/deployed-smart-contracts).
</Note>

Now we can call the `payRoyaltyOnBehalf` function. In this case:

1. `receiverIpId` is the `ipId` of the derivative (child) asset
2. `payerIpId` is `zeroAddress` because the payer is a 3rd party (someone that thinks Mickey Mouse with a hat on him is cool), and not necessarily another IP Asset
3. `token` is the address of \$WIP, which can be found [here](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault#whitelisted-revenue-tokens)
4. `amount` is 2, since the person tipping wants to send 2 \$WIP

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { client } from "./utils";
import { zeroAddress, parseEther } from "viem";
import { WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";

async function main() {
  const response = await client.royalty.payRoyaltyOnBehalf({
    receiverIpId: "0xeaa4Eed346373805B377F5a4fe1daeFeFB3D182a",
    payerIpId: zeroAddress,
    token: WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    amount: parseEther("2"), // 2 $WIP
  });
  console.log(`Paid royalty at transaction hash ${response.txHash}`);
}

main();
```

## 3. Child Claiming Due Revenue

At this point we have already finished the tutorial: we learned how to tip an IP Asset. But what if the child and parent want to claim their due revenue?

The child has been paid 2 \$WIP. But remember, it shares 50% of its revenue with the parent IP because of the `commercialRevenue = 50` in the license terms.

The child IP can claim its 1 \$WIP by calling the `claimAllRevenue` function:

* `ancestorIpId` is the `ipId` we're claiming revenue for
* `currencyTokens` is an array that contains the address of \$WIP, which can be found [here](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault#whitelisted-revenue-tokens)
* `claimer` is the address that holds the [royalty tokens](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault#royalty-tokens) associated with the child's [IP Royalty Vault](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault). By default, they are in the IP Account, which is just the `ipId` of the child asset.

<Note>
  Claiming revenue is permissionless. Any wallet can run the claim revenue transaction for an IP.
</Note>

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { client } from "./utils";
import { zeroAddress, parseEther } from "viem";
import { WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";

async function main() {
  // previous code here ...
  const response = await client.royalty.claimAllRevenue({
    ancestorIpId: "0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2",
    claimer: "0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2",
    currencyTokens: [WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS],
    childIpIds: [],
    royaltyPolicies: [],
  });

  console.log(`Claimed revenue: ${response.claimedTokens}`);
}

main();
```

## 4. Parent Claiming Due Revenue

Continuing, the parent should be able to claim its revenue as well. In this example, the parent should be able to claim 1 \$WIP since the child earned 2 \$WIP and the `commercialRevShare = 50` in the license terms.

We will use the `claimAllRevenue` function to claim the due revenue tokens.

1. `ancestorIpId` is the `ipId` of the parent ("ancestor") asset
2. `claimer` is the address that holds the royalty tokens associated with the parent's [IP Royalty Vault](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault). By default, they are in the IP Account, which is just the `ipId` of the parent asset
3. `childIpIds` will have the `ipId` of the child asset
4. `royaltyPolicies` will contain the address of the royalty policy. As explained in [Royalty Module](/concepts/royalty-module), this is either `RoyaltyPolicyLAP` or `RoyaltyPolicyLRP`, depending on the license terms. In this case, let's assume the license terms specify a `RoyaltyPolicyLAP`. Simply go to [Deployed Smart Contracts](/developers/deployed-smart-contracts) and find the correct address.
5. `currencyTokens` is an array that contains the address of \$WIP, which can be found [here](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault#whitelisted-revenue-tokens)

<Note>
  Claiming revenue is permissionless. Any wallet can run the claim revenue transaction for an IP.
</Note>

```typescript main.ts theme={null}
import { client } from "./utils";
import { zeroAddress, parseEther } from "viem";
import { WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";

async function main() {
  // previous code here ...

  const response = await client.royalty.claimAllRevenue({
    ancestorIpId: "0x089d75C9b7E441dA3115AF93FF9A855BDdbfe384",
    claimer: "0x089d75C9b7E441dA3115AF93FF9A855BDdbfe384",
    currencyTokens: [WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS],
    childIpIds: ["0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2"],
    royaltyPolicies: ["0xBe54FB168b3c982b7AaE60dB6CF75Bd8447b390E"],
  });

  console.log(`Claimed revenue: ${response.claimedTokens}`);
}

main();
```

## 5. Where does revenue get claimed to? Why do I not see it in my wallet? Why is it in the IP Account?

A couple of things to note here:

1. By default, revenue is claimed to the IP Account, not the IP owner's
   wallet. This is because when an IP is created, the royalty tokens for that IP
   (where revenue gets claimed to) are minted to the IP Account.

2. To transfer revenue from IP Account -> IP Owner's wallet, an IP owner can
   run the `transferErc20` function (it will not work
   if you run it for someone else's IP obviously).

   ```typescript main.ts theme={null}
   // Docs: https://docs.story.foundation/sdk-reference/ipaccount#transfererc20
   const transferFromIpAccount = await client.ipAccount.transferErc20({
     ipId: "0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2",
     tokens: [
       {
         address: WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
         amount: parseEther("1"),
         target: "0x02", // the external wallet
       },
     ],
   });
   ```

3. If the **IP owner** (the wallet that owns the underlying IP ownership NFT) had
   called `claimAllRevenue` before, our SDK would automatically transfer the revenue
   to the IP owner's wallet for convenience.

4. If the IP owner wants revenue to always be claimed to their wallet and
   avoid the middle step, they should transfer the royalty tokens from the IP
   account to their wallet.

   ```typescript main.ts theme={null}
   // Get the IP Royalty Vault Address
   // Note: This is equivalent to the currency address of the ERC-20
   // Royalty Tokens for this IP.
   const royaltyVaultAddress = await client.royalty.getRoyaltyVaultAddress(
     "0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2" as Address
   );

   // Transfer the Royalty Tokens from the IP Account to the address
   // executing this transaction (you could use any other address as well)
   const transferRoyaltyTokens = await client.ipAccount.transferErc20({
     ipId: "0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2" as Address,
     tokens: [
       {
         address: royaltyVaultAddress,
         amount: 100 * 1_000_000, // 100% of the royalty tokens
         target: "0x02", // the external wallet
       },
     ],
   });
   ```

## Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get an API Key">
    In order to use Halliday, you will need to get an API key. Right now the process is to email [partnerships@halliday.xyz](mailto:partnerships@halliday.xyz). But this may change, so I recommend checking the [Halliday Docs](https://docs.halliday.xyz/pages/payments-hello-world) for the most up to date information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Halliday">
    Next, install the Halliday Payments SDK in the root folder of your project.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm theme={null}
      npm install @halliday-sdk/payments
      ```

      ```bash yarn theme={null}
      yarn add @halliday-sdk/payments
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup Your .env">
    In your `.env` file, add your Halliday API key.

    ```env  theme={null}
    NEXT_PUBLIC_HALLIDAY_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate Halliday">
    Lastly, integrate Halliday Payments into your existing application with a few lines of code.

    <Note>
      In this example, we make it so that the Halliday popup is embedded in a div with the id `halliday-embed`. Such that when the user loads the page, it is already there. However you can change this so that it pops up when the user clicks a button. Check out the [Halliday Docs](https://docs.halliday.xyz/pages/payments-widget) for more information.
    </Note>

    ```tsx  theme={null}
    "use client";
    import { openHallidayPayments } from "@halliday-sdk/payments";
    import { useEffect } from "react";

    export default function Home() {
      useEffect(() => {
        openHallidayPayments({
          apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HALLIDAY_PUBLIC_API_KEY as string,
          // $IP on Story
          outputs: ["story:0x"],
          // $USDC.e on Story
          // outputs: ["story:0xf1815bd50389c46847f0bda824ec8da914045d14"],
          sandbox: false,
          windowType: "EMBED",
          targetElementId: "halliday-embed",
        });
      }, []);

      return (
        <div
          className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-white"
          id="halliday-embed"
        ></div>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it! You can now use Halliday to purchase \$IP on Story.

# Email Login & Sponsored Transactions with Privy

> Learn how to implement email logins and sponsored transactions with Privy & Pimlico.

You are reading this tutorial because you probably want to do one or both of these things:

1. Enable users who don't have a wallet to login with email to your app ("Embedded Wallets")
2. Sponsor transactions for your users so they don't have to pay gas ("Smart Wallets")

Here is how Privy describes both of these things:

> Embedded wallets are self-custodial wallets provisioned by Privy itself for a wallet experience that is directly embedded in your application. Embedded wallets do not require a separate wallet client, like a browser extension or a mobile app, and can be accessed directly from your product. These are primarily designed for users of your app who may not already have an external wallet, or don't want to connect their external wallet.
>
> Smart wallets are programmable, onchain accounts that incorporate the features of account abstraction. With just a few lines of code, you can create smart wallets for your users to sponsor gas payments, send batched transactions, and more.

We will be implementing both using [Privy](https://www.privy.io/) + [Pimlico](https://www.pimlico.io/).

### ⚠️ Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Create a new project on [Privy's Dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io)
2. Copy your **"App ID"** under **"App settings > API keys"**. In your local project, make a `.env` file and add your App ID:

```Text .env theme={null}
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=
```

3. On your project dashboard, enable Smart Wallets under "**Wallet Configuration > Smart wallets**" and select "**Kernel (ZeroDev)**" as shown below:

</Frame>

4. Once you enable Smart wallets, right underneath make sure to put a "Custom chain" with the following values:
   1. Name: `Story Aeneid Testnet`
   2. ID number: `1315`
   3. RPC URL: `https://aeneid.storyrpc.io`
   4. For the Bundler URL and Paymaster URL, go to [Pimlico's Dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io) and create a new app. Then click on "API Keys", create a new API Key, click "RPC URLs" as shown below, and then select "Story Aeneid Testnet" as the network:

<Warning>
  This is for testing. In a real scenario, you would have to set up proper sponsorship policies and billing info on Pimlico to automatically sponsor the transactions on behalf of your app. We don't have to do this on testnet.
</Warning>

5. Install the dependencies:

```Text Terminal theme={null}
npm install @story-protocol/core-sdk permissionless viem @privy-io/react-auth
```

## 1. Set up Embedded Wallets

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Official Privy Tutoral" href="https://docs.privy.io/wallets/using-wallets/evm-smart-wallets/setup/configuring-dashboard" icon="house">
    Follow Privy's official tutorial for setup instead of reading this step.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  This part of the Privy documentation
  [here](https://docs.privy.io/basics/react/advanced/automatic-wallet-creation#automatic-wallet-creation)
  describes setting up Embedded Wallets automatically, which is a fancy way of
  saying it supports email login, such that when a user logs in with email it
  creates a wallet for them. In the below example, we simply create an embedded
  wallet for every user, but you may want more customization by reading their
  tutorial.
</Note>

You must wrap any component that will be using embedded/smart wallets with the `PrivyProvider` and `SmartWalletsProvider`. In a `providers.tsx` (or whatever you want to call it) file, add the following code:

```jsx providers.tsx theme={null}
"use client";

import { PrivyProvider } from "@privy-io/react-auth";
import { SmartWalletsProvider } from "@privy-io/react-auth/smart-wallets";
import { aeneid } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";

export default function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <PrivyProvider
      appId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID as string}
      config={{
        // Customize Privy's appearance in your app
        appearance: {
          theme: "light",
          accentColor: "#676FFF",
          logo: "/story-logo.jpg",
        },
        // Create embedded wallets for users who don't have a wallet
        // when they sign in with email
        embeddedWallets: {
          createOnLogin: "all-users",
        },
        defaultChain: aeneid,
        supportedChains: [aeneid],
      }}
    >
      <SmartWalletsProvider>{children}</SmartWalletsProvider>
    </PrivyProvider>
  );
}
```

Then you can simply add it to your`layout.tsx` like so:

```jsx layout.tsx theme={null}
import Providers from "@/providers/providers";

/* other code here... */

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode,
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body
        className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}
      >
        <Providers>{children}</Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## 2. Login & Logout

You can add email login to your app like so:

```jsx page.tsx theme={null}
import { usePrivy } from "@privy-io/react-auth";

export default function Home() {
  const { login, logout, user } = usePrivy();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (user) {
      const smartWallet = user.linkedAccounts.find(
        (account) => account.type === "smart_wallet"
      );
      // Logs the smart wallet's address
      console.log(smartWallet.address);
      // Logs the smart wallet type (e.g. 'safe', 'kernel', 'light_account', 'biconomy', 'thirdweb', 'coinbase_smart_wallet')
      console.log(smartWallet.type);
    }
  }, [user]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={user ? logout : login}>
        {user ? "Logout" : "Login with Privy"}
      </button>
    </div>

We can use the generated smart wallet to sign messages:

```jsx page.tsx theme={null}
import { useSmartWallets } from "@privy-io/react-auth/smart-wallets";

export default function Home() {
  const { client: smartWalletClient } = useSmartWallets();

  /* previous code here */

  async function sign() {
    const uiOptions = {
      title: "Example Sign",
      description: "This is an example for a user to sign.",
      buttonText: "Sign",
    };
    const request = {
      message: "IP is cool",

    const signature = await smartWalletClient?.signMessage(request, {
      uiOptions,
    });
  }

  return (

## 5. Send a Transaction from Story SDK

We can also use the generated smart wallet to send transactions from the [🛠️ TypeScript SDK](/developers/typescript-sdk). Some of the functions have an option to return the `encodedTxData`, which we can use to pass into Privy's smart wallet. You can see which functions support this in the [SDK Reference](/sdk-reference).

```jsx page.tsx theme={null}
import { useSmartWallets } from "@privy-io/react-auth/smart-wallets";
import {
  EncodedTxData,
  StoryClient,
  StoryConfig,
} from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
import { http } from "viem";

export default function Home() {
  const { client: smartWalletClient } = useSmartWallets();

  /* previous code here */

  async function setupStoryClient() {
    const config: StoryConfig = {
      account: smartWalletClient!.account,
      transport: http("https://aeneid.storyrpc.io"),
      chainId: "aeneid",
    };
    const client = StoryClient.newClient(config);
    return client;
  }

  async function registerIp() {
    const storyClient = await setupStoryClient();

    const response = await storyClient.ipAsset.registerIpAsset({
      nft: {
        type: "mint",
        spgNftContract: "0xc32A8a0FF3beDDDa58393d022aF433e78739FAbc",
      },
    });

    const uiOptions = {
      title: "Register IP",
      description: "This is an example transaction that registers an IP.",
      buttonText: "Register",
    };

    const txHash = await smartWalletClient?.sendTransaction(
      response.encodedTxData as EncodedTxData,
      { uiOptions }
    );
    console.log(`View Tx: https://aeneid.storyscan.io/tx/${txHash}`);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* previous code here */}
      <button onClick={registerIp}>Register IP</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Encode Function Data

> A short tutorial on how to encode Story smart contract function data for things like Crossmint.

Sometimes you want to encode smart contract function data for things like [sending arbitrary transactions via Crossmint](https://docs.crossmint.com/solutions/story-protocol/wallets/server-side-wallets#send-arbitrary-transaction).

As seen [in Crossmint's docs](https://docs.crossmint.com/solutions/story-protocol/wallets/server-side-wallets#send-arbitrary-transaction), you can get encoded function data via Story's SDK. However this is shortly going to be deprecated and it does not support every function anyway.

So here's a quick tutorial on how to get encoded function data for any Story smart contract function.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Completed Code" href="https://github.com/storyprotocol/typescript-tutorial/blob/main/scripts/misc/sendRawTransaction.ts" icon="code">
    View the completed code for this tutorial.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 1: Get the function data

As an example, let's try to call the [mintAndRegisterIpAndAttachPilTerms](https://github.com/storyprotocol/protocol-periphery-v1/blob/main/contracts/workflows/LicenseAttachmentWorkflows.sol#L130) in our periphery contract. This function mints & registers a new IP and attaches [PIL Terms](/concepts/programmable-ip-license/pil-terms) to it.

As shown in [Deployed Smart Contracts](/developers/deployed-smart-contracts), `LicenseAttachmentWorkflows` is deployed at `0xcC2E862bCee5B6036Db0de6E06Ae87e524a79fd8` on Aeneid (at the time of writing this tutorial).

There's a few things we'll need:

1. Contract ABI - you can get this by going to [our block explorer and looking up the contract](https://aeneid.storyscan.io/address/0xcC2E862bCee5B6036Db0de6E06Ae87e524a79fd8). This is a proxy contract, so go to Contract > Read/Write proxy > Click on the implementation address > Contract > ABI. After all that, you should end up [here](https://aeneid.storyscan.io/address/0x887c22833bf7F8E0E19F7d994fec964A82c030FB?tab=contract_abi).

2. Function Args - you can get these just by looking at the [code](https://github.com/storyprotocol/protocol-periphery-v1/blob/main/contracts/workflows/LicenseAttachmentWorkflows.sol#L130).

Great! Now let's build our transaction request.

```typescript  theme={null}
import { encodeFunctionData } from "viem";
import { Account, Address, privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";

const account: Account = privateKeyToAccount(
  `0x${process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY}` as Address
);

const transactionRequest = {
  to: "0xcC2E862bCee5B6036Db0de6E06Ae87e524a79fd8" as `0x${string}`,
  data: encodeFunctionData({
    abi: CONTRACT_ABI, // the abi you copied above
    functionName: "mintAndRegisterIpAndAttachPILTerms",
    args: [
      "0xc32A8a0FF3beDDDa58393d022aF433e78739FAbc", // example spg nft contract I use on Aeneid
      account.address,
      // example metadata values
      {
        ipMetadataURI:
          "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreiabrkevameeffdpjpizchywldogzai7kp5oodawbhgbojyeomk7uq",
        ipMetadataHash:
          "0x018a895030842946f4bd1911f1658dc6c811f53fae70c1609cc1727047315fa4",
        nftMetadataURI:
          "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreicbuti233kvewqs7uwb5y2toexj5gafgvsr5mqmnnx7cuof53gvsa",
        nftMetadataHash:
          "0x41a4d1aded5525a12fd2c1ee353712e9e980535651eb20c6b6ff151c5eecd590",
      },
      // example PIL terms
      [
        {
          terms: {
            transferable: true,
            royaltyPolicy: "0xBe54FB168b3c982b7AaE60dB6CF75Bd8447b390E",
            defaultMintingFee: 0n,
            expiration: 0n,
            commercialUse: true,
            commercialAttribution: true,
            commercializerChecker: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
            commercializerCheckerData: "0x",

            currency: "0x1514000000000000000000000000000000000000",
            uri: "https://github.com/piplabs/pil-document/blob/ad67bb632a310d2557f8abcccd428e4c9c798db1/off-chain-terms/CommercialRemix.json",
          },
          licensingConfig: {
            mintingFee: 0n,
            isSet: false,
            disabled: false,
            commercialRevShare: 0,
            expectGroupRewardPool: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
            expectMinimumGroupRewardShare: 0,
            licensingHook: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
            hookData: "0x",
          },
        },
      ],
      true,
    ],
  }),
};
```

## Step 2: Send the transaction

At this point, we have the `data` and `to` needed for sending this transaction, for example if we were using [Crossmint](https://docs.crossmint.com/solutions/story-protocol/wallets/server-side-wallets#send-arbitrary-transaction).

However we could also then send this transaction ourselves:

```typescript  theme={null}
import { aeneid } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
import { createWalletClient, http, WalletClient } from "viem";

// other code here

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: aeneid,
  transport: http("https://aeneid.storyrpc.io"),
  account,
}) as WalletClient;

const txHash = await walletClient.sendTransaction({
  ...transactionRequest,
  account,
  chain: aeneid,
});

console.log(`Transaction sent: https://aeneid.storyscan.io/tx/${txHash}`);
```

# List Collections

> Retrieve a list of collections with pagination and filtering options. Collections can be ordered by updatedAt, assetCount, or licensesCount (asc/desc). Collections are automatically enriched with metadata. The 'where' field is optional and should only be provided when filtering by specific collection addresses or asset counts. This endpoint can also be used to fetch a single collection by passing its address in the collectionAddresses filter. Collections that don't exist in Alchemy or encounter errors will return with empty metadata instead of failing the entire request.

# List Disputes

> Retrieve a paginated, filtered list of disputes from the SOS database. 
This endpoint supports various filtering options including:
- Filter by dispute ID, target IP ID, initiator address, or status
- Filter by block number ranges (blockNumber, blockNumberLte, blockNumberGte)
- Sort by block number, dispute timestamp, or ID
- Pagination with configurable limit and offset

Key v4 Enhancements:
- Flattened request structure: Query parameters are directly in the request body, not nested in an "options" object
- Offset-based pagination: Unlike v3, this endpoint supports both limit and offset parameters for flexible pagination
- Block number range filtering: Added blockNumberGte for greater-than-or-equal filtering (complements existing blockNumberLte)
- Pagination metadata in response: Returns total count and hasMore flag

The response format is aligned with v3 for compatibility, using big integers for numeric fields and hex strings for data fields.

# IP Asset

> IPAssetClient allows you to create, get, and list IP Assets within Story.

## IPAssetClient

### Methods

* registerIpAsset
* registerDerivativeIpAsset
* linkDerivative

### registerIpAsset

Register your IP as an [🧩 IP Asset](/concepts/ip-asset). It supports the following workflows:

1. Register an IP Asset
   1a. register an existing NFT as an IP Asset
   1b. mint a new NFT and register as an IP Asset
2. Attach license terms to the IP Asset
3. Distribute royalty tokens

<Note title="NFT Metadata">
  Note that this function will also set the underlying NFT's `tokenUri` to
  whatever is passed under `ipMetadata.nftMetadataURI`.
</Note>

| Method            | Type                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `registerIpAsset` | `(request: RegisterIpAssetRequest) => Promise<RegisterIpAssetResponse>` |

Parameters:

* `request.nft`: You have two options here
  * `{ type: "minted", nftContract: Address, tokenId: number | bigint }`: Register an existing NFT as an IP Asset. This is typically the harder option because you need to already have an NFT minted.
  * `{ type: "mint", spgNftContract: Address, recipient?: Address, allowDuplicates?: boolean }`: Mint a new NFT and register as an IP Asset. This is typically the easier option because you don't need to worry about already having an NFT minted. Just create an spgNftContract, or use a default one, to mint for you.
* `request.licenseTermsData`: If you want to attach license terms.
  * `request.licenseTermsData.terms`: The [license terms](/concepts/programmable-ip-license/pil-terms) to attach to the IP Asset.
  * `request.licenseTermsData.licensingConfig`: The [licensing config](/concepts/licensing-module/license-config) to attach to the IP Asset.
  * `request.licenseTermsData.maxLicenseTokens`: The max number of license tokens that can be minted from this license term.
* `request.royaltyShares`: If you want to distribute royalty tokens out.
  * `request.royaltyShares.recipient`: The address of the recipient of the royalty shares.
  * `request.royaltyShares.percentage`: The percentage of the royalty shares.
* `request.ipMetadata`: The metadata of the IP Asset
  * `request.ipMetadata.ipMetadataURI`: The URI of the metadata for the IP.
  * `request.ipMetadata.ipMetadataHash`: The hash of the metadata for the IP.

### registerDerivativeIpAsset

Register an IP as a derivative of another IP Asset. This function allows you to use an existing license token to register as derivative, or it will mint one for you. To register an IP as a derivative, it must be an IP Asset itself. So this function allows you to register an existing NFT as an IP Asset (which will be the derivative), or mint a new NFT for you (and register it as a derivative).

| Method                      | Type                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `registerDerivativeIpAsset` | `(request: RegisterDerivativeIpRequest) => Promise<RegisterDerivativeIpResponse>` |

Parameters:

* `request.nft`: You have two options here
  * `{ type: "minted", nftContract: Address, tokenId: number | bigint }`: Register an existing NFT as an IP Asset. This is typically the harder option because you need to already have an NFT minted.
  * `{ type: "mint", spgNftContract: Address, recipient?: Address, allowDuplicates?: boolean }`: Mint a new NFT and register as an IP Asset. This is typically the easier option because you don't need to worry about already having an NFT minted. Just create an spgNftContract, or use a default one, to mint for you.
* `request.licenseTokenIds`: If you want to use a license token to register as derivative.
* `request.derivData`: If you want to mint a license token for you.
  * `request.derivData.parentIpIds`: The IDs of the parent IPs to link the registered derivative IP.
  * `request.derivData.licenseTermsIds`: The IDs of the license terms to be used for the linking.
* `request.royaltyShares`: If you want to distribute royalty tokens out.
  * `request.royaltyShares.recipient`: The address of the recipient of the royalty shares.
  * `request.royaltyShares.percentage`: The percentage of the royalty shares.
* `request.maxRts`: The maximum number of royalty tokens that can be distributed to the external royalty policies. Must be between 0 and 100,000,000. **Recommended for simplicity: 100\_000\_000**
* `request.ipMetadata`: The metadata of the IP Asset
  * `request.ipMetadata.ipMetadataURI`: The URI of the metadata for the IP.
  * `request.ipMetadata.ipMetadataHash`: The hash of the metadata for the IP.
  * `request.ipMetadata.nftMetadataURI`: The URI of the metadata for the NFT.
  * `request.ipMetadata.nftMetadataHash`: The hash of the metadata for the IP NFT.
* `request.deadline`: The deadline for the signature in milliseconds. **Defaults to 1000**.

### mintLicenseTokens

Mints [License Tokens](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token) that give permission to use the IP Asset based on [License Terms](/concepts/licensing-module/license-terms). The license tokens are minted to the `receiver`.

Note that a license token can only be minted if the `licenseTermsId` are already attached to the IP Asset, making it a publicly available license. The IP owner can, however, mint a [private license](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token#private-licenses) by minting a license token with a `licenseTermsId` that is not attached to the IP Asset.

<Warning>
  It might require the caller pay a minting fee, depending on the license terms or configured by the IP owner. The minting fee is paid in the minting fee token specified in the license terms or configured by the IP owner. IP owners can configure the minting fee of their IPs or configure the minting fee module to determine the minting fee.
</Warning>

* tagIfRelatedIpInfringed
* disputeAssertion
* disputeIdToAssertionId

### raiseDispute

Raises a dispute on a given ipId

| Method         | Type                                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `raiseDispute` | `(request: RaiseDisputeRequest) => Promise<RaiseDisputeResponse>` |

Parameters:

* `request.targetIpId`: The IP ID that is the target of the dispute.
* `request.targetTag`: The target tag of the dispute. See [dispute tags](https://docs.story.foundation/docs/dispute-module#dispute-tags). **Example: "IMPROPER\_REGISTRATION"**
* `request.cid`: Content Identifier (CID) for the dispute evidence. This should be obtained by uploading your dispute evidence (documents, images, etc.) to IPFS. **Example: "QmX4zdp8VpzqvtKuEqMo6gfZPdoUx9TeHXCgzKLcFfSUbk"**
* `request.liveness`: The liveness is the time window (in seconds) in which a counter dispute can be presented (30days).
* `request.bond`: \[Optional] **If not specified, it defaults to the minimum bond value**. The amount of wrapper IP that the dispute initiator pays upfront into a pool. To counter that dispute the opposite party of the dispute has to place a bond of the same amount. The winner of the dispute gets the original bond back + 50% of the other party bond. The remaining 50% of the loser party bond goes to the reviewer.

<Note>
  UMA will be adjusting the minimum \$IP bond size as the IP price fluctuates.
  The correct way to obtain the current minimum bond size is via
  `getMinimumBond()` on `OptimisticOracleV3.sol` (OOV3), found on our [aeneid
  testnet](https://aeneid.storyscan.io/address/0xABac6a158431edED06EE6cba37eDE8779F599eE4?tab=read_write_contract#0x4360af3d)

</Note>

* `request.wipOptions`: \[Optional]
  * `request.wipOptions.enableAutoWrapIp`: \[Optional]By default IP is converted to WIP if the current WIP balance does not cover the fees. Set this to `false` to disable this behavior. **Default: true**
  * `request.wipOptions.enableAutoApprove`: \[Optional]Automatically approve WIP usage when WIP is needed but current allowance is not sufficient. Set this to `false` to disable this behavior. **Default: true**

### disputeAssertion

Counters a dispute that was raised by another party on an IP using counter evidence.

This method can only be called by the IP's owner to counter a dispute by providing counter evidence. The counter evidence (e.g., documents, images) should be uploaded to IPFS, and its corresponding CID is converted to a hash for the request.

If you only have a `disputeId`, call `disputeIdToAssertionId` to get the `assertionId` needed here.

| Method             | Type                                                                 |

| `disputeAssertion` | `(request: DisputeAssertionRequest) => Promise<TransactionResponse>` |

Parameters:

* `request.ipId`: The IP ID that is the target of the dispute.
* `request.assertionId`: The identifier of the assertion that was disputed. You can get this from the `disputeId` by calling `dispute.disputeIdToAssertionId`.
* `request.counterEvidenceCID`: Content Identifier (CID) for the counter evidence. This should be obtained by uploading your dispute evidence (documents, images, etc.) to IPFS. **Example: "QmX4zdp8VpzqvtKuEqMo6gfZPdoUx9TeHXCgzKLcFfSUbk"**
* `request.wipOptions`: \[Optional]
  * `request.wipOptions.enableAutoWrapIp`: \[Optional]By default IP is converted to WIP if the current WIP balance does not cover the fees. Set this to `false` to disable this behavior. **Default: true**
  * `request.wipOptions.enableAutoApprove`: \[Optional]Automatically approve WIP usage when WIP is needed but current allowance is not sufficient. Set this to `false` to disable this behavior. **Default: true**

* `request.payerIpId`: The ID of the IP asset that pays the royalties.

* `request.token`: The token to use to pay the royalties.

* `request.amount`: The amount to pay.

* `request.wipOptions`: \[Optional]
  * `request.wipOptions.useMulticallWhenPossible`: \[Optional] Use multicall to batch the WIP calls into one transaction when possible. **Default: true**
  * `request.wipOptions.enableAutoWrapIp`: \[Optional] By default IP is converted to WIP if the current WIP balance does not cover the fees. Set this to `false` to disable this behavior. **Default: true**
  * `request.wipOptions.enableAutoApprove`: \[Optional] Automatically approve WIP usage when WIP is needed but current allowance is not sufficient. Set this to `false` to disable this behavior. **Default: true**

* `request.erc20Options`: \[Optional]
  * `request.erc20Options.enableAutoApprove`: \[Optional] Automatically approve ERC20 usage when ERC20 is needed but current allowance is not sufficient. Set this to `false` to disable this behavior. **Default: true**

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import { WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
  import { parseEther, zeroAddress } from "viem";

  // In this case, lets say there is a root IPA 'A' and a derivative IPA 'B'.
  // Someone wants to pay 'B' for whatever reason (they bought it, they want to tip it, etc).
  // Since the payer is not an IP Asset (rather an external user), the `payerIpId` can
  // be a zeroAddress. And the receiver is, well, the receiver's ipId which is B.
  //
  // It's important to note that both 'B' and its parent 'A' will be able
  // to claim revenue from this based on the negotiated license terms
  const payRoyalty = await client.royalty.payRoyaltyOnBehalf({
    receiverIpId: "0x0b825D9E5FA196e6B563C0a446e8D9885057f9B1", // B's ipId

    token: WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    amount: parseEther("2"), // 2 $WIP
  });
  console.log(`Paid royalty at transaction hash ${payRoyalty.txHash}`);

  // In this case, lets say there is a root IPA 'A' and a derivative IPA 'B'.
  // 'B' earns revenue off-chain, but must pay 'A' based on their negotiated license terms.
  // So 'B' pays 'A' what they are due
  const payRoyalty = await client.royalty.payRoyaltyOnBehalf({
    receiverIpId: "0x6B86B39F03558A8a4E9252d73F2bDeBfBedf5b68", // A's ipId

| Method             | Type                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claimableRevenue` | `(request: ClaimableRevenueRequest) => Promise<ClaimableRevenueResponse>` |

Parameters:

* `request.ipId`: The id of the royalty vault.
* `request.claimer`: The address of the royalty token holder. This is most commonly the IP Account, since by default the IP Account is the owner of the royalty tokens.
* `request.token`: The revenue token to claim.

Parameters:

* `request.ancestorIpId`: The address of the ancestor IP from which the revenue is being claimed.
* `request.claimer`: The address of the claimer of the currency (revenue) tokens. This is normally the ipId of the ancestor IP if the IP has all royalty tokens. Otherwise, this would be the address that is holding the ancestor IP royalty tokens.
* `request.childIpIds[]`: The addresses of the child IPs from which royalties are derived.
* `request.royaltyPolicies[]`: The addresses of the royalty policies, where royaltyPolicies\[i] governs the royalty flow for childIpIds\[i].
* `request.currencyTokens[]`: The addresses of the currency tokens in which royalties will be claimed.
* `request.claimOptions`: \[Optional]
  * `request.claimOptions.autoTransferAllClaimedTokensFromIp`: \[Optional] When enabled, all claimed tokens on the claimer are transferred to the wallet address if the wallet owns the IP. If the wallet is the claimer or if the claimer is not an IP owned by the wallet, then the tokens will not be transferred. Set to false to disable auto transferring claimed tokens from the claimer. **Default: true**
  * `request.claimOptions.autoUnwrapIpTokens`: \[Optional] By default all claimed WIP tokens are converted back to IP after they are transferred. Set this to false to disable this behavior. **Default: false**

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}

# Permissions

> PermissionClient allows you to manage permissions for IP Accounts within Story.

## PermissionClient

### Methods

* setPermission
* createSetPermissionSignature
* setAllPermissions
* setBatchPermissions
* createBatchPermissionSignature

### setPermission

Sets the permission for a specific function call.

Each policy is represented as a mapping from an IP account address to a signer address to a recipient\
address to a function selector to a permission level. The permission level can be 0 (ABSTAIN), 1 (ALLOW), or\
2 (DENY).

By default, all policies are set to 0 (ABSTAIN), which means that the permission is not set. The owner of IP Account by default has all permission.

| Method          | Type                                                                  |

* `signer`: The signer of the transaction
* `signature`: The signature of the transaction

## Security Considerations

The IPAccountImpl contract implements several security measures:

1. **Permission System**: Uses an AccessController to manage permissions for different signers and operations.

2. **Signature Verification**: Implements EIP-712 typed data signing for secure transaction authorization.

3. **Deadline Checking**: Includes transaction deadlines to prevent replay attacks.

4. **Nonce Management**: Uses a state (nonce) system to prevent transaction replay.

5. **Input Validation**: Validates inputs and checks for edge cases, such as preventing invalid operations.

6. **Signature Malleability Protection**: Includes protections against signature malleability attacks.

7. **Limited Operations**: Only supports the CALL operation (0) for security reasons, restricting potentially dangerous operations.

8. **Upgradability Disabled**: The contract disables UUPS upgradability to ensure contract immutability.

## Usage Examples

### Executing a Transaction

An IP asset owner can execute a transaction through their IP Account:

```solidity  theme={null}
// Assuming 'ipAccount' is an instance of IPAccountImpl
ipAccount.execute(
    targetContract,
    0, // No ETH sent
    abi.encodeWithSignature("someFunction(uint256)", 123)
);
```

### Executing with a Signature

A permitted signer can execute a transaction on behalf of the IP Account:

```solidity  theme={null}
// Generate signature off-chain
bytes signature = signEIP712Message(...);

// Execute transaction
ipAccount.executeWithSig(
    targetContract,
    0, // No ETH sent
    abi.encodeWithSignature("someFunction(uint256)", 123),
    signer,
    deadline,
    signature
);
```

## Security Considerations

The ModuleRegistry contract implements several security measures:

1. **Access Control**: Most functions are restricted to be called only by the protocol admin through the `restricted` modifier.

2. **Input Validation**: The contract validates all inputs to ensure they meet the required criteria:
   * Module addresses must be non-zero and must be contracts
   * Names and module types cannot be empty strings
   * Module types must be registered before modules of that type can be registered
   * Modules must support the expected interface for their type

3. **Duplicate Prevention**: The contract prevents duplicate registrations:
   * A module type cannot be registered twice with the same name
   * A module cannot be registered twice with different names
   * A name cannot be used for multiple modules

## Events

### RevenueTransferredToVault

```solidity  theme={null}
event RevenueTransferredToVault(address ipId, address ancestorIpId, address token, uint256 amount)
```

Emitted when revenue tokens are transferred to a vault.

**Parameters:**

* `ipId`: The ipId of the IP asset
* `ancestorIpId`: The ancestor ipId of the IP asset
* `token`: The token address transferred
* `amount`: The amount of tokens transferred

## Security Considerations

The RoyaltyPolicyLRP contract implements several security measures:

1. **Access Control**: Functions like `onLicenseMinting` and `onLinkToParents` can only be called by the Royalty Module through the `onlyRoyaltyModule` modifier.

2. **Reentrancy Protection**: The `nonReentrant` modifier is used on functions that handle token transfers to prevent reentrancy attacks.

3. **Pausability**: The contract can be paused in emergency situations using the `whenNotPaused` modifier.

4. **Safe Token Transfers**: The contract uses OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library to ensure safe token transfers.

5. **Upgradability**: The contract is upgradable using the UUPS pattern, with upgrade authorization restricted to the protocol admin.

6. **Input Validation**: The contract validates inputs and checks for edge cases, such as preventing transfers between the same IP.

## Royalty Dilution Considerations

The LRP (Liquid Relative Percentage) royalty policy allows each remixed IP to receive a percentage of the revenue generated by its direct derivatives. However, it's important to understand the potential dilution of royalties as more derivatives are created between two IPs.

This dilution can reduce the earnings of the original IP creator as more layers of derivatives are added. For example:

1. Creator 1 - Registers IP1, mints an LRP license of 10%, and sells the license to Creator 2.
2. Creator 2 - Registers IP2 as a derivative of IP1 and mints an LRP license of 20% for himself/herself.
3. Creator 2 - Registers IP3 as a derivative of IP2 and promotes IP3 commercially in the market.

The earnings for Creator 1 are diluted because they will only receive 10% of the 20% royalties from IP3, resulting in an effective royalty of 2%. If Creator 2 had chosen to promote IP2 instead, Creator 1 would have earned 10% directly, avoiding this dilution.

In contrast, the LAP (Liquid Absolute Percentage) royalty policy enforces a fixed percentage on every descendant IP, protecting the original creator from dilution.
